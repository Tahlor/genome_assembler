<H2><A NAME="SEC160" HREF="scripting_toc.html#SEC160">Other I/O functions</A></H2>
<P>
This section includes all the other I/O functions which don't fit well into
the other sections. Specifically, these functions cannot be used when
compiling external programs that utilise the gap4 I/O functions. The reason
for this is that they require many other portions of the gap4 objects which in
turn require more.

</P>
<P>
Whilst it is possible to still link in this manner, it is unwieldy and far
from ideal. If you have need to use any of these functions in code that is to
run separate from Gap4 then please mail us. We will then investigate tidying
up the code further to aid such compilations.
