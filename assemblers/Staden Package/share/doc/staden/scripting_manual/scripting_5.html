<STRONG>load_package</STRONG> <I>name</I>
</PRE>

<P>
This loads the dynamic library named (eg) lib<I>name</I>.so. The "lib" and
".so" components of this library name a system dependent strings. The system
will automatically use the correct local terminology depending on the system
type.

</P>
<P>
Firstly the <CODE>$STADLIB/</CODE><I>name</I> directory is appended to Tcl auto_path
variable. Next the <CODE>$STADTABL/</CODE><I>name</I><CODE>rc</CODE> file is used to specify
the package menus and defaults (which are saved as a keyed list in the global
tcl variable <I>name</I>_defs). The <CODE>.</CODE><I>name</I><CODE>rc</CODE> file is also loaded
up from the callers HOME directory and from the current directory, if they
exist, in this order.  This means that a user can override defaults specified
in the <CODE>STADTABL</CODE> directory by creating an rc file in their home
directory, and then to override these specifications further in a
project-by-project fashion by adding configurations to the current directory.

</P>
<P>
Next the library itself is dynamically loaded. The file to be loaded is held
within the <CODE>$STADLIB/$MACHINE-binaries</CODE> directory. If the library does
not exist within this directory then it is not loaded and no error is
produced.

</P>
<P>
Finally if existent, the package initialisation function in C will then be
called with a Tcl interpreter as the sole argument and returns an integer
(TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR). It is this function which performs the registering of
new commands to the Tcl language. The C function name must be the package name
with the first character as upper case, the following characters as lowercase,
and suffixed by <CODE>_Init</CODE>. See the Tcl load manual page for full details.

</P>
<P>
So for the tk_utils library the <CODE>$STADLIB/tk_utils</CODE> directory is added to
the auto_path variable, the <CODE>$STADTABL/tk_utilsrc</CODE> file is processed, and
executes the C function <CODE>Tk_utils_Init()</CODE>.

<STRONG>load_package</STRONG> <I>tcldir libdir name ?init?</I>
</PRE>

<P>
This is the more versatile form of the load_package command. The procedures
performed are the same, however the location of the files is no longer
controlled solely by environment variables.

</P>
<P>
<I>Tcldir</I> specifies the directory to add to the Tcl auto_path variable and is
used for the search path of the <I>name</I><CODE>rc</CODE> file. As with the simpler
form of load_package the <CODE>STADTABL</CODE>, HOME, and current directory versions
of the rc file are also loaded, with each file overriding values specified in
the earlier copies.

</P>
<P>
The <I>libdir</I> argument specifies the location to find the dynamic library
file to load. Specifying this as a single <CODE>-</CODE> (minus sign) requests that
no dynamic library is to be loaded. In this way libraries consisting solely of
Tcl files may be used. Specifying <I>libdir</I> as a blank string (either "" or
{}) indicates that the library is to be searched for in the users
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
Both the <I>tcldir</I> and <I>libdir</I> variables allow a few substitutions to
expand up to common locations.

</P>

<DT><VAR>%L</VAR>
<DD>
Expands to <CODE>$STADLIB</CODE>
<DT><VAR>%S</VAR>
<DD>
Expands to <CODE>$STADENROOT/src</CODE>
<DT><VAR>%%</VAR>
<DD>
Expands to a single percent sign
</DL>

<P>
The <I>init</I> argument is used to indicate whether the dynamic library loaded
has an initialisation routine. It should be set to 0 or 1. The current
implementation always attemps to execute the initialisation routine, but
when <I>init</I> is 0 errors will be ignored.
