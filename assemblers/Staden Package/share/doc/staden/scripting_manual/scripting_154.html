<P>
This function calculates the consensus sequence for a given segment of a
contig. It can produce a single consensus sequence using all readings, or
split it into two sequences; one for each strand. Additionally, it can produce
either one (combinded strands) or two (individual strands) sets of values
relating to the accuracy of the returned consensus.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>contig</VAR>, <VAR>start</VAR> and <VAR>end</VAR> arguments hold the contig and
range to calculate the consensus for. The ranges are inclusive and start
counting with the first base as position 1.

</P>
<P>
<VAR>con</VAR> and <VAR>con2</VAR> are buffers to store the consensus. These are
allocated by the caller to be at least of size <VAR>end-start+1</VAR>. If
<VAR>con2</VAR> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> both strands are calculated as a single consensus to
be stored in <VAR>con</VAR>. Otherwise the top strand is stored in <VAR>con</VAR> and
the bottom strand is stored in <VAR>con2</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
<VAR>mode</VAR> should be one of <CODE>CON_SUM</CODE> or <CODE>CON_WDET</CODE>. <CODE>CON_SUM</CODE>
is the "normal" mode, which indicates that the consensus sequence is simply
the most likely base or a dash (depending on <VAR>cons_cutoff</VAR>. The
<CODE>CON_WDET</CODE> mode is used to return special characters for bases that are
good quality and identical on both strands. Where one strand has a dash, the
consensus base for the other strand is used. Where both strands differ, and
are not dashes, the consensus is returned as dash. Note that despite requiring
the consensus for each starnd independently, this mode requires that
<VAR>con2</VAR> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. To summarise the action of the <CODE>CON_WDET</CODE>
mode, the final consensus is derived as follows:

   <VAR>x</VAR>        <VAR>y</VAR>         -
</PRE>

<P>
[Where <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> are one of A, C, G or T, and <VAR>x</VAR> != <VAR>y</VAR>.]

</P>
<P>
<VAR>qual_cutoff</VAR> and <VAR>cons_cutoff</VAR> hold the quality and consensus cutoff
paramaters used in the consensus algorithm for determining which bases are of
sufficient quality to use and by how big a majority this base type must have
before it is returned as the consensus base (otherwise "-" is used). For a
complete description of how these parameters operate see the consensus
algorithm description in the main Gap4 manual. (FIXME: should we duplicate
this here?)

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>qual</VAR> and <VAR>qual2</VAR> buffers are allocated by the caller to be the
same size as the <VAR>con</VAR> and <VAR>con2</VAR> buffers. They are filled with the
a floating point representing the ratio of score for the consensus base type
to the score for all base types (where the definition of score depends on the
<VAR>qual_cutoff</VAR> parameter). This is the value compared against
<VAR>cons_cutoff</VAR> to determine whether the consensus base is a dash.
Either or both of <VAR>qual</VAR> and <VAR>qual2</VAR> can be passed as NULL if no
accuracy information is required. Note that the accuracy information for
<VAR>qual2</VAR> is only available when <VAR>con2</VAR> has also been passed as non NULL.

</P>
<P>
The algorithm uses <VAR>info_func</VAR> to obtain information about the readings
from the database. <VAR>info_data</VAR> is passed as the second argument
(<VAR>mydata</VAR>) to <VAR>info_func</VAR>. <VAR>info_func</VAR> is called each time some
information is required about a reading or contig. It's purpose is to abstract
out the algorithm from the data source. There are currently two such
functions, the most commonly used of which is <CODE>database_info</CODE> function
(the other being <CODE>contEd_info</CODE> to fetch data from the contig editor
structures). The <CODE>database_info</CODE> function obtains the sequence details
from the database. It requires a <VAR>GapIO</VAR> pointer to be passed as
<VAR>info_data</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The function returns 0 for success, -1 for failure.
