Each function wishing to access a contig on a long term basis needs to
register itself before accessing the data. For example, the template display
and contig editors should register, but show relationships produces a report
taken from a single snap shot of the data and so does not need to register.

</P>
<P>
The idea of registering is to allow communication between views of the same
(or derived) data, this insuring that they can be automatically kept up to
date when modifications are made, and can provide mechanisms to prevent
multiple, incompatible, edits of the same data. An example can be seen in the
template display. Suppose we have the display showing contig 4. A join contig
operation links this to contig 7 and produces a new contig -- number 10.
Other contig numbers may have shuffled too: if we had 9 contigs then contig 9
may well be renumbered to contig 4.

</P>
<P>
Therefore we need to notify any functions displaying contig 9 of a contig
number change. We also need to notify displays of contig 4 that the number is
now 10, and both this and contig 7 that the contents and length has changed.

</P>
<P>
Central to the scheme is the result manager. This displays a list of which
data is registered and provides a further method for the user to interrogate
specific results.

</P>
<P>
Notifications may also be for requesting data as well as informing changes.
All registered items must respond to certain notifications, such as for
determining the name of the function, so that it can be listed in the results
manager.
