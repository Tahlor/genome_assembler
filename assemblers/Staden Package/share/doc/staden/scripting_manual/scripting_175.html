<P>
For each contig we maintain a list of displays of this data. We register by
supplying a function (of a specific type) to our registration scheme, along
with any data of our own (called our <I>client_data</I>) that we wish to be
passed back. When an operation is performed on this contig the function that
we specified is called along with our own client_data and a description of the
operation made. A function often does not need to be told of all changes, so
when registering it's possible to list only those operations that should be
responded to.

</P>
<P>
In addition to maintaining the above information, each registration contains
an identifier, a time stamp, a type, and an "id" value.

</P>
<P>
The identifier is a simply number that is used to specify a single registered
data, or a group of registered data. An example of it's use is within the
contig selector; the selector is registered on all contigs, but each
registration has the same identifier. A new identifier is returned by calling
the <CODE>register_id</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
The time stamp is allocated automatically when the <CODE>contig_register</CODE>
function is called. It is displayed within the results manager.

</P>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX766"></A>
<A NAME="IDX767"></A>
<A NAME="IDX768"></A>
<A NAME="IDX769"></A>
<A NAME="IDX770"></A>
<A NAME="IDX771"></A>
<A NAME="IDX772"></A>

The type is used to flag a registered data as belonging to a specific
function. This is useful for when we wish to send a notification to all
instances of a particular display, or to query whether the contig editor is
running (such as performed by the stop codon display). The current types known
are:

</P>

<PRE>
REG_TYPE_UNKNOWN
REG_TYPE_EDITOR
REG_TYPE_FIJ
REG_TYPE_READPAIR
REG_TYPE_REPEAT
REG_TYPE_QUALITY
REG_TYPE_TEMPLATE
REG_TYPE_RESTRICTION
REG_TYPE_STOPCODON
REG_TYPE_CONTIGSEL
REG_TYPE_CHECKASS
REG_TYPE_OLIGO
</PRE>

<P>
The id value is used to distinguish which pieces of data are connected. Each
"result" has a single id value, but may consist of multiple pieces of
registered data, all sharing the same id.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX779"></A>
<A NAME="IDX780"></A>
So the registration consists of the following structure:

</P>

<PRE>
typedef struct {
    void  (*func)(
                  GapIO    *io,
                  int       contig,
                  void     *fdata,
                  reg_data *jdata);
    void   *fdata;
    int     id;
    time_t  time;
    int     flags;
    int     type;
    int     uid; /* A _unique_ identifier for this contig_reg_t */
} contig_reg_t;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>func</CODE> and <CODE>fdata</CODE> are the callback functions and
client_data. <VAR>uid</VAR> is a number unique to all registrations, even those
that have common <VAR>id</VAR> values. You need not be concerned about it's use; it
is internal to the registration system.

</P>
<P>
Hence the total memory used by the registration system is an array of arrays
of above structures. One array per contig, containing an array of
<VAR>contig_reg_t</VAR> structs.

</P>
<P>
A notification of an action involves creating a <VAR>reg_data</VAR> structure and
sending this to one of the notification functions (such as
<CODE>contig_notify</CODE>). The <VAR>reg_data</VAR> structure is infact a union of many
structure types; one for each notification type. In common to all these types
is the job field. This must be filled out with the current notification type.
See section <A HREF="scripting_178.html#SEC197">The Notifications Available</A>.

</P>
<P>
As <VAR>reg_data</VAR> is a union of structures, it must be access by a further
pointer indirection. For instance, to determine the position of the contig
editor cursor from a <CODE>REG_CURSOR_NOTIFY</CODE> notification we need to write
"<CODE>reg_data-&#62;cursor_notify-&#62;pos</CODE>" rather than simply
"<CODE>reg_data-&#62;pos</CODE>". The complete list of union names can be found in
io-reg.h. The current list is summarised below. The types and use of these
structures will be discussed in further detail later.

</P>

<PRE>
typedef union _reg_data {
    /* MUST be first here and in job data structs */
    int job;
    
    reg_generic         generic;
    reg_number          number;
    reg_join            join;
    reg_order           order;
    reg_length          length;
    reg_query_name      name;
    reg_delete          delete;
    reg_complement      complement;
    reg_get_lock        glock;
    reg_set_lock        slock;
    reg_quit            quit;
    reg_get_ops         get_ops;
    reg_invoke_op       invoke_op;
    reg_params          params;
    reg_cursor_notify   cursor_notify;
    reg_anno            annotations;
    reg_register        c_register;
    reg_deregister      c_deregister;
    reg_highlight_read  highlight;
    reg_buffer_start    buffer_start;
    reg_buffer_end      buffer_end;
} reg_data;
