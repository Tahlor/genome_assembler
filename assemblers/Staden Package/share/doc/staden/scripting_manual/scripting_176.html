<H2><A NAME="SEC195" HREF="scripting_toc.html#SEC195">Registering a Piece of Data</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX783"></A>

</P>
<P>
To register data several things need to be known; the contig number, the
callback function, the client_data (typically the address of the data to
register), the list of notifications to respond to, an indentifier, and the
"type" of this data (one of the <CODE>REG_TYPE_</CODE> macros).

</P>
<P>
If the data needs updating when more than one specific contig changes, then
the data should be registered with more than one contig.

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>contig_register</CODE> function to register an item. The prototype
is:

</P>

<PRE>
#include &#60;io-reg.h&#62;

int contig_register(
        GapIO  *io,
        int     contig,
        void  (*func)(
                      GapIO     *io,
                      int        contig,
                      void      *fdata,
                      reg_data  *jdata),
        void   *fdata,
        int     id,
        int     flags,
        int     type);
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>contig</VAR> is a contig number in the C sense (<CODE>1</CODE> to
<CODE>NumContigs(io)</CODE>), not a gel reading number.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>fdata</VAR> (the client_data mentioned before) can be anything you wish.
It will be passed back to the callback function <VAR>func</VAR> when a notification
is made.  Typically it's best to simply pass the address of your data that you
wish to keep up to date. If your data is not a single pointer then turn it
into one by creating a structure containing all the relevant pointers.

</P>
<P>
The id number is usually unique for each time an option it ran, but common to
all registrations of this particular piece of data. This is not a hard and
fast rule -- it depends on how you wish to interact with this data. For
instance, the contig selector window registers with all contigs so that it can
be notified when any contig changes. The same <VAR>id</VAR> is used for each of
these registrations as it is the collection of registrations as a whole which
is required for the display.

</P>
<P>
"Flags" is used to request which notifications should be sent to this callback
function. Each notification has a name which is actually a #define for a
number. This names can be ORed together to generate a bit field of
acknowledged requests. There are some predefined bitfields (for shortening the
function call) that can themselves be ORed together. See section <A HREF="scripting_178.html#SEC197">The Notifications Available</A>.  Finally, one special flag can be ORed on to
request that this function does not appear in the results manager window. This
flag is <CODE>REG_FLAG_INVIS</CODE>: see the contig selector code for an example.

</P>
<P>
An example of using <CODE>contig_register</CODE> can be seen in the stop codon plot.
Our stop codon results are all held within a structure of type
<VAR>mobj_stop</VAR>. The general outline of our stop codon code is as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
mobj_stop *s;
int id;

if (NULL == (s = (mobj_stop *)xmalloc(sizeof(mobj_stop)))) {
    return 0;
}

[ Fill in our 's' structure with our results ]

DrawStopCodons(s);
id = register_id();
contig_register(io, contig_number, stop_codon_callback, (void *)s, id,
                REG_REQUIRED | REG_DATA_CHANGE | REG_OPS | REG_GENERIC
                | REG_NUMBER_CHANGE | REG_REGISTERS | REG_CURSOR_NOTIFY,
                REG_TYPE_STOPCODON);
</PRE>

<P>
Here we've requested that the result <VAR>s</VAR>, of type
<CODE>REG_TYPE_STOPCODON</CODE>, should be passed to the <CODE>stop_codon_callback</CODE>
function whenever a notification of type <CODE>REG_REQUIRED</CODE>,
<CODE>REG_DATA_CHANGE</CODE>, <CODE>REG_OPS</CODE>, <CODE>REG_GENERIC</CODE>,
<CODE>REG_NUMBER_CHANGE</CODE>, <CODE>REG_REGISTERS</CODE> or <CODE>REG_CURSOR_NOTIFY</CODE>
occurs. These notification types are actually combinations of types, but more
on this later.
