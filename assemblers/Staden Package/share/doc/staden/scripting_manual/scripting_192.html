<P>
As contig numbers must always be from 1 to N, where N is the number of
contigs, if we remove a particular contig, we need to ensure we still have
contigs 1 to N-1. In thise case, deleting contig x, where x != N, will mean
that we have a hole (at x) which can be filled by moving N down to x.

</P>
<P>
To illustrate in an algorithm we have the following; Given N contigs and a
request to delete contig x.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Delete contig x. This is a NULL operation as far as the
<CODE>io_delete_contig</CODE> operation goes as we're already assuming the data on
this contig has gone elsewhere.
<LI>

Move contig N to contig x (if x != N). This includes updating the disk
images as well as the fortran arrays and the contig order, but not the
registration lists -- yet.
<LI>

Decrement the number of contigs. (N--)
<LI>

Notify contig x of the delete using REG_DELETE.
<LI>

Notify contig N of the renumber to contig x using REG_NUMBER_CHANGE.
(if appropriate)
<LI>

Update registration list information.
</OL>

<P>
Hence it is important to remember that after an <CODE>io_delete_contig</CODE> the
contig numbers may not be the same as before the call.
