The restriction enzyme plot within the template display is a reduced version
of the main Restriction Enzyme Map function. The dialogue used for choosing
the restriction enzymes is identical and is described with the main function.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="gap5_30.html#SEC64">Plotting Restriction Enzymes</A>.
It is invoked from the Template Display View menu.
An example plot from the template display can be seen below.

<P>
Here we see the searches for two restriction enzymes. Each vertical line is
drawn at the cut position of the matched restriction site. Unlike the main
restriction enzyme plot here all matches are plotted on a single
horizontal plot. Initially all sites are drawn in black. To distinguish one
site from another either touch the site with the mouse cursor and read the 
template
display information line, or place the mouse cursor above a site and press
the right mouse button. This pops up a menu containing "Information" and
"Configure". The "Configure" option can be used to change the colour of all
matches found for this enzyme. In the figure above we have changed
the initial colours for both of the restriction enzymes searched for. The
"Information" command displays information for all sites found in the text
output window.

</P>
<P>
As with the main Restriction Enzyme Map function, clicking the left mouse
button on two restriction sites in turn displays the distance between the
chosen sites in the information line. This figure is also displayed in the box
at the top right hand corner of the template display.
