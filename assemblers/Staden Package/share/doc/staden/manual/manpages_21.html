<H2><A NAME="SEC128" HREF="manpages_toc.html#SEC128">DESCRIPTION</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>screen_seq</CODE> searches sequence readings to
filter out those from extraneous DNA
such as vector or bacterial sequences. We have separated this task
from that of locating and marking the extents of sequencing vector and
other cloning vectors. There we require precise identification of the
junction between the vectors and the target DNA. The filtering process
described here is designed to spot strong matches between readings and a
panel of possible contaminating sequences, and it splits readings into
passes and fails. Readings that fail have a PS line containing the word
"contaminant" and a tag of type "CONT" added to their experiment file.

</P>
<P>
Normal usage would be to compare a batch of readings in experiment file
format against a batch of possible contaminant sequences stored in (at
present) simple text files. Each batch is presented to the program as a
file of file names, and the program will write out two new files of file
names: one containing the names of the files that do not match any of
the contaminant sequences (the passes), and the other those that do
match (the
fails). It is also possible to compare single readings and single
contaminant files by giving their file names (i.e. it is not necessary
to use a file of file names for single files).

</P>
<P>
Given the frequent need to compare against the full E. coli genome the
algorithm is designed to be fast. The user controls the speed and
sensitivity by supplying a single parameter, "min_match".
The program will find the longest exact match of at
least min_match characters.

</P>
<P>
The search is
conducted only over the clipped portion of the readings. On our Alpha machine
it takes about 1 second to compare both strands of a reading against the
4.7 million bases of E. coli.

</P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE> <I>Length of minimum match (25)</I>
<DD>
        The length of match required to initiate a closer search.

<DT><CODE>-m</CODE> <I>Maximum vector length (100000)</I>
<DD>
        The maximum length of the longest sequence to screen the readings against.

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE> <I>Input file of reading file names</I>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-I</CODE> <I>Input file of single reading to screen</I>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-s</CODE> <I>Input file of sequence file names to screen against</I>
<DD>

<DD>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE> <I>Test only mode</I>
<DD>
        In test mode no experiment files are changed and the results are written
        to stdout. When not in test mode a dot "." is written to stdout for each
        comparison, and an exclamation mark "!" for each error detected.

<H2><A NAME="SEC130" HREF="manpages_toc.html#SEC130">EXAMPLES</A></H2>


<PRE>
Usage: screen_seq [options and paramters] 
Where options and parameters are:
    [-l minimum match (25)]           [-m Max vector length (100000)]
    [-i readings to screen fofn]      [-I reading to screen]
    [-s seqs to screen against fofn]  [-S seq to screen against]
    [-t test only]
    [-p passed fofn]                  [-f failed fofn]
</PRE>

<P>
1. Screen the readings whose names are stored in fofn against a batch of
possible contaminant sequences whose names are stored in vnames. Write
the names of the readings that pass to file p and those that fail to
file f. Increase the maximum sequence length to 5000,000 characters and
require a minimum match of 20.

</P>


<PRE>
<CODE>screen_seq -i fofn -s vnames -p p -f f -l20 -m5000000</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
2. Screen the single reading stored in xpg33.g1 against a batch of
possible contaminant sequences whose names are stored in vnames. If the
reading does not match write its name to file p, otherwise to
file f. Increase the maximum sequence length to 5000,000 characters and
require a minimum match of 20.

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>screen_seq -I xpg33.g1 -s vnames -p p -f f -l20 -m5000000</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>
3. Screen the readings whose names are stored in fofn against a single
possible contaminant sequence stored in ecoli.seq. Write
the names of the readings that pass to file pass and those that fail to
file fails. Increase the maximum sequence length to 5000,000 characters and
require minimum  match of 20.

</P>

<PRE>
<CODE>screen_seq -i fofn -S ecoli.seq -p pass -f fails -l20 -m5000000</CODE>
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="manpages_toc.html#SEC131">NOTES</A></H2>

<P>
Limits

</P>
<P>
Screen_seq is currently set to be able to process a maximum of 10,000
readings and 5000 screening sequences in a single run. The maximum
length of any screening sequence is 100,000 although this can be
overridden by use of the -m parameter (set it to 5000000 for E. coli).
At present the sequences to screen against must be stored in simple text
files containing individual sequences, with no entry names, and &#60;100
characters per line.

</P>

<P>
The following errors can be reported.
