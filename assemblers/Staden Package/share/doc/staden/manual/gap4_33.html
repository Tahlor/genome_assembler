This option can be invoked from the main gap4 View menu, in which case
it appears as a single plot, or from the View menu of the Template
Display, in which case it will appear as part of the Template Display.

</P>
<P>
This display provides an overview of the quality of the consensus. The
Contig Editor can be used to examine the problems revealed. A typical
plot is displayed below.

<P>
For each base in the consensus a quality is
computed based on the accuracy of the data on each strand. As can be seen in
the Figure above, this information
is then plotted using colour and height to distinguish between the
different quality assignments.
The colour and height codes are explained below.

</P>

<PRE>
Colour  Height          Meaning

grey    0 to 0          OK on both strands, both agree
blue    0 to 1          OK on plus strand only
green  -1 to 0          OK on minus strand only
red    -1 to 1          Bad on both strands
black  -2 to 2          OK on both strands but they disagree
</PRE>

<P>
For example, in the figure we see that the first four hundred or so
bases are mostly only well determined on the forward strand.

</P>
<P>
Note that when a large number of bases are being displayed the limited screen 
resolution causes the
quality codes for adjacent bases to be drawn as single pixels. However
the use of varying heights ensures that all problematic bases will be
visible. Hence when
the quality plot consists of a single grey line all known quality problems
have been resolved, at the current consensus and quality cutoffs.

</P>
<P>
To check problems the contig editor can be invoked by double clicking on the
middle mouse button, or Alt left mouse button. 
It will appear centred on the base corresponding to the
position on which the mouse was clicked.

</P>
<P>
The quality plot appears as "Calculate quality" in the Results Manager window
(see section <A HREF="gap5_68.html#SEC106">Results Manager</A>).

</P>
<P>
Within the Results Manager commands available, using the right mouse
button, include "Information",
which lists a summary of
the distribution of quality types to the output window, and "List" which lists
the actual quality values for each base to the output window. These quality
values are written in a textual form of single letters per base and are listed
below.
