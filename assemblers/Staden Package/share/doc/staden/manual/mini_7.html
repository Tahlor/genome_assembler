<P>
Before entry into a gap4 database the raw data from sequencing instruments
needs to be passed through several processes, such as screening for vectors,
quality evaluation, and conversion of data formats. 
Pregap4 is used to pass a batch of
readings through these steps in an automatic way. It provides an
interface for setting up and configuring the processing and for
controlling the passage of the readings through each stage.
The separate tasks are termed "modules" and each module is typically
managed by a dedicated program. Pregap4 wraps all of these
modules into a single easy to use environment, whilst maintaining the
flexibility to select and extend the processing modules.
It is an, as yet, 
unpublished replacement of the program pregap
<CITE>Bonfield, J.K. and Staden, R. Experiment files and their application
during large-scale sequencing projects. DNA Sequence 6, 109-117 (1996)</CITE>.

<P>
Gap4 stores the data for an assembly project in a gap4
database. Before being entered into the gap4 database the data must be
passed through several steps via pregap4. The range
of tasks that can be peformed using pregap4 are shown schematically in
the following figure.

</P>
<P>
@image{pregap4_overview,4.45833in}

</P>

<P>
The package can handle data produced by a variety of sequencing
instruments, and also data entered using digitisers or that has been typed in by
hand. One of the first steps is to convert trace files, such as those of
ABI, which are in proprietary format, to SCF files.  

</P>
<P>
Next, as originally put forward in <CITE>Bonfield,J.K. and Staden,R. The application of
numerical estimates of base calling accuracy to DNA sequencing
projects. Nucleic Acids Research 23, 1406-1410 (1995)</CITE>, if they are not already included in the files,
base call confidence values are calculated, and are 
normally stored in the reading's SCF file.

</P>
<P>
Next the base calls are copied from the trace files 
to text files known as Experiment files. 

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>

</P>
<P>
Note it is also possible to enter sequence readings in the form of FASTA
files for use at this stage of the processing, in which case they will be
automatically converted to Experiment file format.

</P>
<P>
All the subsequent processes operate on the Experiment files.

</P>
<P>
Experiment file format is similar to that of EMBL sequence entries in
that each record starts with a two letter identifier, but we have
invented new records specific to sequencing experiments. 
Gap4 can make use of information about readings which may not be
contained within the raw data files, such as sequencing chemistry and whether
it is a forward or reverse reading. Gap4 will work without this information,
but at a reduced level. For instance knowing which forward and reverse
readings belong together allows gap4 to check the validity of assembly
and for automatic ordering of contigs.

</P>
<P>
One of
pregap4's next tasks is to augment the Experiment files to include data about
the chemistry, vectors, primers and templates used in the production of each
reading, and if necessary it can extract this information from external
databases, or via
local reading name conventions.
Once the Experiment file for a reading contains all the necessary
information the remaining processing programs can be used in turn to
analyse the data. 

</P>
<P>
First the reading is marked at both ends to define the range of
reasonable quality base calls.

</P>
<P>
Then the reading is searched for the
presence of sequencing vector at the 5' end 3' ends.

</P>
<P>
Next the sequence is checked for the presence of "cloning" vector,
i.e. non-sequencing vectors, such as those of BACs.

</P>
<P>
The final check of this type is to screen the reading for any vector
that may have been missed in the previous searches.

</P>
<P>
The next check is to screen the reading for any set of
sequences which it may be contaminated by, such as E. coli.

</P>
<P>
Note that vector sequence files are normally stored in the package
vectors directory/folder. If a file of vector file names is used the
vector sequences can also be stored in its directory/folder. Files
of file names and vector-primer files can also contain environment
variables to define the location of vector files.

</P>
<P>
Vector_primer files, vector sequence files and files of file names
must be stored in plain text files.

</P>
<P>
Pregap4 is usually used non-interactively once the modules have been
configured, but some groups prefer (or have the time) to check the data
by eye using the program trev at this stage.

</P>
<P>
Another option is to search the readings for families of known repeats. This will tag any
regions which are found to match known repeats.

</P>
<P>
Some groups are using the package for mutation studies and 
the final pregap4 option, prior to assembly is to use the mutation scanner program to search the readings for mutations
(@xref{Pregap4-Modules-Mutation Scanner,Pregap4-Modules-Mutation Scanner,Mutation Scanner}.

</P>
<P>
Pregap4 can also be used to assemble the readings into a gap4 database, or
to assemble the readings using an external assembly engine such as FAKII,
and then to enter that assembly into a gap4 database.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>

</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that any particular user will want to employ all of these
options and one of pregap4's modes of use is to enable users to
configure the program for their work.
Not only can they select which
tasks should be performed, and which of the alternative programs
("modules") should be used for them, but also the order in which they are
applied. Although it is very rarely a problem, this high level of
flexibility comes at a price in the current version of pregap4: pregap4
does not include code to check on the logicality of the configuration
set by a user and will attempt to execute the modules in the order
given. There are some users, who having read this section, will
configure pregap4 to perform assembly before creating the Experiment
files from the trace files. Pregap4 will attempt to do this and 
no data will be assembled as the files given to the assembly engine
will be in the wrong format. This is just something to be aware of.

</P>
<P>
Pregap4 uses configuration files to remember the setup for each user or
project. These files define which modules are activated and what their
parameter settings are. These files,
which can obviously save considerable amounts of time, are created
automatically and can be saved from the Configure Modules Window once
the configuration is complete.

</P>

<P>
The trace files are not altered, but are kept as archival data so that
it is always possible to check the original base calls and traces. The
trace files are used by gap4 to display traces and to compare the final
consensus sequence with the original data, therefore they must be kept
online for the lifetime of the project. To save disk space it is best to use
SCF files and, if they were derived from a proprietary format such as
that of ABI, to remove the originals. 

</P>
<P>
Any changes to the data prior to assembly
(and we recommend that none are made until readings
can be viewed aligned with others) are made to the copy of the sequence
in the Experiment file. For example the results of all the searching
procedures outlined above are added as new records to each reading's
Experiment file.
The reading data, in Experiment file format, is entered into the project
database,
usually via one of the assembly engines. All the changes to
the data made by gap4 are made to the copies of the data in the project
database.  Once the data has been copied into the gap4 database the
Experiment files are no longer required.

<P>
During processing pregap4 uses temporary files. The number and nature of
these files depends on the modules used. At the very least pregap4 will
produce files containing the names of the input files and the result of
their processing. Those that were processed successfully will be stored
in a file with a name ending ".passed" and those that failed in one
ending ".failed". The ".passed" file can be used as a file of input file
names for assembly into gap4 (assuming that a pregap4 
assembly module has not already been used). 

</P>
<P>
While it is running, pregap4 will 
create files with a file name prefix
defined by the user, and store them
in an output directory of the user's choice.

</P>
<P>
When processing has 
finished pregap4 will produce a report containing information
from each module and the final list of passed and failed sequences.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-Intro-Interface -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="mini_toc.html#SEC32">Introduction to the Pregap4 User Interface</A></H2>

<P>
Pregap4 provides interfaces to define the batch of data files to be
processed, which modules are to applied to them; to configure the
modules, and to start the processing. It also provides mechanisms for
adding and removing modules, but this facility
will be used far less often than the others.

</P>
<P>
Pregap4 supports two styles of windowing. The default method is a compact
mode, with the alternative being "separate" mode - similar to gap4 and
spin.

</P>

<P>
@image{pregap4_separate,5.54167in}

</P>

<P>
This is the "separate" window style. Here the main window is always visible,
with commands in the main window bringing up new windows. In the picture above 
the configure window can be seen on top of the main window.

</P>
<P>
The second style is "compact" mode.

</P>
<P>
@image{pregap4_compact,6in}

</P>

<P>
In the compact picture above the most common top level windows are "pages" in
a tabbed notebook. The benefit is greatly reduced screen space and quicker
controls, but the text output window is no longer permanently visible.
The Window Style can be changed using the options menu.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-Intro-Interface-Files -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="mini_toc.html#SEC33">Introduction to the Files to Process Window</A></H3>

<P>
Pregap4 operates on batches of files. These files can be
binary trace files (in ABI, ALF or SCF format), Experiment Files, or plain
text, and do not need to all be in the same format. The Files to Process
Window is used to define which files are to be processed.
The "Files to Process" dialogue (see below) 
can be brought up from the File menu, or
by pressing the appropriate tab when in <CODE>compact_win</CODE> mode.

</P>
<P>
@image{pregap4_files,6in}

</P>

<P>
On the left hand side of the figure
is the current list of files to process. This list
can be edited simply by clicking with the mouse and typing.

</P>
<P>
On the right side of the panel is the pregap4 output filename prefix, the
output directory name, and several buttons. The filename prefix is used when
pregap4 needs to create files.
For example after processing there may be <I>prefix</I>.passed,
<I>prefix</I>.failed files. All files will be created within the output directory.

</P>
<P>
The buttons allow selection of the files to process. The "Add files" button
will bring up a file browser, which will allow one or more files to be
selected. Pressing Ok on the file browser will then add the selected files to
the "List of files to process" panel on the left side of the pregap4 window.

</P>
<P>
The "Add file of filenames" button may be used to select a list of files whose
filenames have been written to a `file of filenames'. 

</P>
<P>
The "Clear current list" button will
remove all filenames from the list. 

</P>
<P>
Both the "Add files" and "Add file of
filenames" button append their selections to the list of files to process, so
to replace the current list the "Clear current list" button must first be
used. 

</P>
<P>
The "Save current list to..." button may be used to produce a
new file of filenames, containing the combined list of files to process.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-Intro-Interface-Configure -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="mini_toc.html#SEC34">Introduction to the Configure Modules Window</A></H3>

<P>
The "Configure Modules" dialogue is available from the Modules menu or, when
using the compact window style, by pressing the Configure Modules tab.

</P>
<P>
As can be seen in the figure below, 
the left side of the display contains a list of the
currently loaded modules. One module in this list will be highlighted. 
The right side of the display shows the configuration panel for this
highlighted module and is module specific.

</P>
<P>
@image{pregap4_config,6in}

</P>

<P>
The module list shown on the left consists of a series of module names and
their status, and is termed the "enable status". 
The tick or cross at the left of the name indicates whether this
module is enabled. 
The text to the right of the module name indicates whether the
module has been given all the parameters needed for it to run. This will
be one of "ok" (all configuration options have been filled in), "-" (no
configuration options exist for this module), "edit" (further configuration is
required") or blank (this module is disabled).

</P>
<P>
The "enable status" can be toggled by left clicking on the tick/cross to the
left of the module name. The enable status can be written to the current
Pregap4 configuration file using the "Save Module List" or "Save All
Parameters" commands in the Modules menu. Left clicking anywhere on a module
name in the module list will switch the pane on the right side of the window
to display any available parameters for this module. Not all modules will have
parameters to configure.

</P>
<P>
For modules that do have parameters, the top line of the configuration panel
will contain two buttons labelled "Select params to save" and "Save these
parameters". The "Select params to save" button will add check boxes next to
each parameter. Clicking on these check boxes allows selection of individual
parameters to save for this module. Once these have been selected pressing the
"Save" will save only those selected to the pregap4 configuration
file. Pressing the "Save these parameters" button will save all parameters for
this module to the configuration file. 

</P>
<P>
The bottom strip of the window is an "Information Line".

</P>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-Intro-Interface-Output -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="mini_toc.html#SEC35">Introduction to the Textual Output Window</A></H3>

<P>
Pregap4 has a main text output window identical to that of gap4 and spin.
It is used for showing textual results in the top section and
error messages in the lower part. Full details of the user interface are
given elsewhere, but an example of the Text
Output Window is given below.

</P>
<P>
@image{pregap4_textwin,6in}

</P>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-Intro-Interface-Running -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="mini_toc.html#SEC36">Introduction to Running Pregap4</A></H3>

<P>
When pregap4 is started the user first needs to
select the files to process. This is done using the "Files to Process"
command (from the File menu).

</P>
<P>
The "Configure Modules" tab allows for the currently available modules to
be enabled or disabled, and the module parameters edited accordingly.

</P>
<P>
Once all modules have been configured (so that none have <CODE>edit</CODE> listed
next to their name) pregap4 is ready to begin processing. This is
started by pressing
"Run" or by selecting "Run" from the File menu. 

</P>
<P>
When pregap4 has a setup that would be useful in the future
"Save All Parameters (in all modules)" from the Modules menu can be
used, and pregap4 will store all the module parameters to a
configuration file ready for subsequent runs.

</P>

<P>
When processing has 
finished pregap4 will produce a report containing information
from each module and the final list of passed and failed sequences.

</P>
<P>
If for any reason pregap4 fails a particular step in the processing, users
are strongly recommended to correct whatever has caused the module to fail,
clean up any files it has created, and then repeat the whole process. That
is, until users have a good understanding of what happens at each stage of
processing, it is better to repeat all the steps with the original list of
files, than to try to guess which step to continue from.
