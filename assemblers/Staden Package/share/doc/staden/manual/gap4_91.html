This function is used to compare a batch of readings against the data in
an assembly database without entering them. 
It performs "normal shotgun assembly" and records the
percentage mismatch for each matching reading in a file.  If required,
this file
could then be sorted on percentage mismatch and used as a file of file
names for "normal shotgun assembly"; in which case the best matches
would be entered first. The readings in the
batch are only compared to the current contents of the assembly database,
and are not compared against the other readings in the batch.

As explained in normal assembly
(see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Normal Shotgun Assembly</A>)
the user can select to "Apply masking", and if so, the "Select tags"
button will be activated and if it is clicked will bring up a dialogue
to allow tag types to be selected. See section <A HREF="gap4_178.html#SEC266">Tag Selector</A>.

</P>
<P>
The "display mode" dialogue allows the type of output produced to be
set.  "Hide all alignments" means that only the briefest amount of
output will be produced. "Show passed alignments" means that only
alignments that fall inside the entry criteria will be displayed. "Show
all alignments" means that all alignments, including those that fail the
entry criteria, are displayed. "Show only failed alignments" displays
alignments only for the readings that fail the entry criteria.

</P>
<P>
When comparing each reading the program looks first for a "Minimum
initial match", and for each such matching region found it will produce
an alignment. If the "Maximum pads per read" and the "Maximum percent
mismatch" are not exceeded the reading will be entered. The maximum pads
can be inserted in both the reading and the consensus. If users agree we
would prefer to swap the maximum pads criteria for a minimum overlap.
i.e. only overlaps of some minimum length would be accepted.

</P>
<P>
Screening usually works on sets of reading names and they can be read from
either a "file" or a "list" and an appropriate browser is available to enable
users to choose the name of the file or list. If just a single reading is to
be assembled choose "single" and enter the filename instead of the file or list
of filenames.

</P>
<P>
The routine writes the names of all the readings and their alignment scores
expressed as percentage mismatches to a "file" or a "list" and an appropriate
browser is available to enable users to choose the name of the file or list.

</P>
<P>
Previous versions of the package also had the ability to search for matches in 
the "hidden" poor quality data at the ends of contigs. This feature is no
longer available.

</P>
<P>
Note that this option may require the parameter maxseq to be set beforehand
(see section <A HREF="gap4_172.html#SEC260">Set Maxseq</A>). This parameter defines the maximum
length of consensus that can be created.
