<P>
This section explains how to use the program screen_seq to
filter out unwanted readings: i.e. how to
search for and separate readings containing the sequences of extraneous
DNA, such as vector or bacterial sequences. We have separated this task
from that of locating and marking the extents of sequencing vector and
other cloning vectors. There we require precise identification of the
junction between the vectors and the target DNA. The filtering process
described here is designed to spot strong matches between readings and a
panel of possible contaminating sequences, and it splits readings into
passes and fails. Readings that fail have a PS line containing the word
"contaminant" and a "CONT" tag added to
their experiment file.

</P>
<P>
Normal usage would be to compare a batch of readings in experiment file
format against a batch of possible contaminant sequences stored in (at
present) simple text files. Each batch is presented to the program as a
file of file names, and the program will write out two new files of file
names: one containing the names of the files that do not match any of
the contaminant sequences (the passes), and the other those that do
match (the
fails). It is also possible to compare single readings and single
contaminant files by giving their file names (i.e. it is not necessary
to use a file of file names for single files).

</P>
<P>
Given the frequent need to compare against the full E. coli genome the
algorithm is designed to be fast. Only one parameter is required: the minimum
match length, min_match. All readings which contain a segment of sequence
of length min_match which exactly matches a possible contaminant sequence
are filtered out.

</P>

<P>
The search is
conducted only over the clipped portion of the readings. On our aging
Alpha machine
it takes about 1 second to compare both strands of a reading against the
4.7 million bases of E. coli.
