At the left side of the editor window is the "names panel". This
either displays an ASCII pictorial summary of the sequence layout or
the actual sequence names themselves depending on the settings in use.
Between the names panel and the sequences panel is a vertical line,
visible at the right edge of the above image. This can be dragged left
and right to adjust the proportion of display dedicated to the names
and sequence panels.

</P>
<P>
The default name display looks like this:

This plot is a mini diagram of the way the sequences overlap. Here the
&#62; and &#60; symbols represent the start of sequences, assembled on either
the forward or reverse strand, with the ... sections reflecting their
relative lengths. The background shading indicates the mapping quality
of the sequence (which may not be available in many cases, depending
on how the assembly was derived). This should indicate the likelihood
that the sequence has been assembled to the correct point. Sequence
that appears to map elsewhere, e.g. due to a repeat, will be dark grey
while unique sequence will be light grey or white. Moving the mouse
cursor over a sequence will tell you the precise mapping quality along
with additional information such as the sequence name, the technology
used (Sanger, Illumina, 454, etc), and whether it is part of a pair of
sequences.

</P>
<P>
In the editor Settings menu is a checkbox labelled "Pack
Sequences". When checked we permit multiple sequences to be drawn in
the same row. Unchecking this reverts to the Gap4 style of display
where each sequence has its own dedicated row. This also has an affect
on the names panel, which switches to showing the sequence names, as
below.

This still uses the &#62; and &#60; symbols to reflect strand and grey scales
for representing the mapping quality. The &#62; and &#60; are now also
coloured independently.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>light blue

The read is not paired
<LI>white

Forms a consistent pair
<LI>grey

Paired, but the insert size is too large or too small
<LI>red

Paired, but in an invalid orientation
<LI>orange

Paired, but the other end is in another contig
</UL>

<P>
At the bottom of the names panel is an editable text field containing
the current display position. Adjacent to this is a small "P"
indicating these coordinates are "padded". Clicking this will
alternate with "R" to indicate reference coordinates, although these
may not be available in all situations.  Note that currently, for speed
reasons, it cannot directly display unpadded coordinates. 

</P>
<P>
Typing into this position entry-box allows us to direct the editor to a
specific location. If we end the number with "u" it performs an
unpadded to padded conversion before jumping to this location.

</P>
<P>
Left clicking on a name will toggle the background between the current
grey to a shade of blue (with luminosity once again reflecting mapping
quality). This indicates that the sequence name has been added to the
"readings" list. Multiple names may be selected and deselecting by
pressing and holding the left mouse button while moving the mouse
cursor.

</P>
<P>
In both display modes, pressing the right mouse button brings up a
context sensitive menu containing operations relevant to that specific
sequence. This may contain the following commands.

</P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Copy name to clipboard</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Copy #number to clipboard</STRONG>
<DD>
These copy the sequence name or the record number to the clipboard for
use in a subsequent paste operation. Note that there is no visual cue
that this has happened. The same function may also be achieved by
left-clicking and dragging the mouse horiztonally, as if attempting to
highlight a region of text.

These two items are also available when right clicking on the Consensus
label, but in this case it copies the contig name or number to the
clipboard instead.

<DT><STRONG>Goto...</STRONG>
<DD>
This lists other sequences sharing the same template, such as the
other end of a read-pair. Selecting this command will jump the editor
to the left-most base in that sequence. If the sequence is in another
contig then a new editor will be created, unless one already exists
for that contig in which case that other editor will be moved
accordingly.

<DT><STRONG>Join to...</STRONG>
<DD>
In the case of read-pairs that span contigs, the join to function will
bring up the join editor for both contigs involved, automatically
complementing the other contig if appropriate based on the library pair
orientation statistics.
</DL>

<P>
Right clicking on the contig name also pops up a menu. In here are
otions to change the contig name or the starting coordinate. These
options are also available in the editor Commands menu.
