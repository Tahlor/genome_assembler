<P>
The Commands menu is available by either pressing the Commands button
at the top of the contig editor window, or by pressing the Control key
and the left mouse button, or by pressing right mouse button with the
mouse cursor anywhere within the sequence display section of the
contig editor. A menu will be revealed containing the following
options (which are described in greater detail below).

<H3><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC89">Search</A></H3>

<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
Performs a search. See section <A HREF="gap4_61.html#SEC73">Searching</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC90">Create Tag</A></H3>

<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
Creates an annotation. See section <A HREF="gap4_60.html#SEC72">Annotations</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC91">Edit Tag</A></H3>

<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
Edits an annotation. See section <A HREF="gap4_60.html#SEC72">Annotations</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC92" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC92">Delete Tag</A></H3>

<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
Removes an annotation. See section <A HREF="gap4_60.html#SEC72">Annotations</A>.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Save -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC93">Save Contig</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
writes any edited data to disk. The undo history is
cleared and it is no longer possible to quit and abandon these saved
changes. The Control-x followed by Control-s will also save the contig editor
in the same manner as the Save command.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Dump -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC94" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC94">Dump Contig to File</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
outputs the current contig, as currently shown (e.g. with status
lines) to a file. The user can select the region to dump, the length of each
line, and the file name to use. The sequence names can be up to 40 characters, 
but often projects do not use the full length. To avoid wasted space in the
output the number of columns to use for sequence names can be adjusted.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Consensus Trace -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC95">Save Consensus Trace</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
produces a trace file for the consensus sequence by averaging the
traces of the readings. The command brings up a
dialogue containing controls to specify the filename, the consensus start and
end positions, the strand, and whether to use matching reads.

</P>
<P>
As the trace of a reading is dependent on the direction it was read, the
consensus trace can be computed from all the reads in either the forward or
reverse directions, but not both at once. When the "Use only matching reads"
toggle is set to "Yes" only the readings of the correct strand that have the
same base call as the consensus sequence are used. The option is useful for
producing wild-type trace files for a mutation analysis project.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-List Confidence -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC96">List Confidence</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
operates in a very similar manner to the main Gap4 List Confidence
command (see section <A HREF="gap5_64.html#SEC102">List Confidence</A>), except that
it only operates on the current contig, and it
uses the current editor consensus confidences rather than the ones saved to
disk. It displays a dialogue requesting a range within the contig and a
question asking if only summary of the results is required.

</P>
<P>
Pressing OK or Apply will add to the editor information line a count of the
expected number of errors and the error rate. If the "Only update information
line" question was answered "No" then the full frequency table will also be
output. It will appear in the main text output window in the same format
as the "List Confidence"
command in the main Gap4 View menu. The Apply button can be used to calculate
the number of errors without removing the dialogue.

</P>
<P>
It is often the very ends of contigs (which are
generally low coverage and bad quality) that have most of the errors,
and so
it is sometimes useful to set a range which
includes all of the contig except for around 1000 bases from each end.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Report-Mutations -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC97">Report Mutations</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function is used to produce a list of all
the bases annotated with mutation tags (or those bases which differ from
the consensus/reference sequence). If the tags or differences are within
segments of sequence which are also annotated with EMBL feature table CDS
records, the report will include data describing its effect.
The report, which can be sorted by sequence or position, 
includes the reading names, mutation positions relative to the 
reference
sequence, the actual change, its effect, and the evidence. An example is shown
below.

</P>

<PRE>

001321_11aF 33885T&#62;Y (silent F) (strand - only)
001321_11aF 34407G&#62;K (expressed E&#62;[ED]) (strand - only)
001321_11cF 35512T&#62;Y (silent L) (double stranded)
001321_11cF 35813C&#62;Y (expressed P&#62;[PL]) (double stranded)
001321_11dF 36314A&#62;R (expressed E&#62;[EG]) (double stranded)
001321_11eF 36749A&#62;R (expressed K&#62;[KR]) (double stranded)
001321_11eF 37313T&#62;K (noncoding) (strand - only)
000256_11eF 36749A&#62;G (expressed K&#62;R) (double stranded)

</PRE>

<P>
Here the first record is for reading 001321_11aF, position 33885, T changed
to T and C (i.e. is heterozygous) to produce no amino acid change, with evidence coming only from
the complementary strand. The last record is for reading 000256_11eF, position
36749, A changed to G, producing an amino acid change K to R, with evidence
from both strands of the sequence. The penultimate record denotes a 
heterozygote in a noncoding region.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Primer Selection -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC98">Select Primer</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
allows the user to employ the primer selection algorithm OSP to
find primers for sequencing experiments. See section <A HREF="gap4_65.html#SEC124">Primer Selection</A>.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Align -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC99">Align</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
performs a sequence alignment between the currently selected segment of a
reading and the consensus sequence. It provides a simple way of extending the
visible part of a reading to use its hidden data, which is often useful to
double strand a short section of consensus without the need to perform further
experiments.  On a sequence, highlight the cutoff data to align along with a
small section of the good quality non-cutoff data. Then select the align
command and adjust the cutoff point as desired.  Pads are inserted in the
consensus and readings as necessary, although pads will not be inserted in the
cutoff data of other sequences.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Remove Reading -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC100">Remove Reading</A></H3>

<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
marks a reading for subsequent removal. See section <A HREF="gap4_64.html#SEC123">Removing Readings</A>

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Comm-Break Contig -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC101">Break Contig</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>

</P>
<P>
This Contig Editor Commands menu function
breaks the contig so that the reading underneath the editing cursor is
the left end of a new contig. In order to perform this operation all edits
are saved automatically first. Once saved these edits cannot be undone. This
operation is identical to the Break Contig command in the main menu.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="gap5_51.html#SEC88">Break Contig</A>.
