This mode works like normal assembly (see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Normal Shotgun Assembly</A>) with masking, except that the masking is done for regions
that already have sufficient data on both strands of the sequence. This means
that new readings will only be assembled into regions that are single stranded
or which border, and overlap, such segments. Note that this means that
readings that do not match are not entered, therefore those that would
actually lie between contigs are rejected.

The "display mode" dialogue allows the type of output produced to be
set.  "Hide all alignments" means that only the briefest amount of
output will be produced. "Show passed alignments" means that only
alignments that fall inside the entry criteria will be displayed. "Show
all alignments" means that all alignments, including those that fail the
entry criteria, are displayed. "Show only failed alignments" displays
alignments only for the readings that fail the entry criteria.

</P>
<P>
When comparing each reading the program looks first for a "Minimum
initial match", and for each such matching region found it will produce
an alignment. If the "Maximum pads per read" and the "Maximum percent
mismatch" are not exceeded the reading will be entered. The maximum pads
can be inserted in both the reading and the consensus. If users agree we
would prefer to swap the maximum pads criteria for a minimum overlap.
i.e. only overlaps of some minimum length would be accepted.

</P>
<P>
Assembly usually works on sets of reading names and they can be read from
either a "file" or a "list" and an appropriate browser is available to enable
users to choose the name of the file or list. If just a single reading is to
be assembled choose "single" and enter the filename instead of the file or list
of filenames.

</P>
<P>
The routine writes the names of all the readings that are not entered to a
"file" or a "list" and an appropriate browser is available to enable users to
choose the name of the file or list.  Occasionally it might be convenient to
forbid joins between contigs to be made if a new reading overlaps them both,
but the default is to "Permit joins".

</P>
<P>
Pressing the "OK" button will start the assembly process.

</P>
<P>
Note that this option may require the parameter maxseq to be set beforehand
(see section <A HREF="gap4_172.html#SEC260">Set Maxseq</A>). This parameter defines the maximum
length of consensus that can be created.
