This option 
(which is available from the gap4 Experiments menu)
searches through a region of a contig looking for stop (STOP) or
compression (COMP) tags.  These tags could have been added using the Contig
Editor or by a suitable external program which can analyse traces to detect
these types of problems. For each such tag found the routine produces a list
of readings that could be resequenced to try to solve the problem. Obviously
the types of experiments available will change as the technology
improves but at present the program produces output that suggests "Taq
terminator" experiments. We welcome suggestions for other experiment types or
news of any programs that can automatically assign the tags. The results, in
the form of suggestions, are written to the Output window.

Note that the Taq reading length is used as  a  guideline  for
deciding  which  readings  are  suitable  candidates  for  solving a
problem. All readings in the correct orientation and with their 5'  ends
within  this  length  are  assumed  to solve the problem. The actual
distance is listed in the output; an example of this is shown below.

  Prob 1544..1545: COMP tag on strand 0 (forward)
     Taq for xd26d8.s1          1365 179

     Taq for xd26d8.s1          1365 189

<DD>
marks the inclusive range for the tag in the contig.
<DT><CODE>&#60;type&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
is the type of the current tag.
<DT><CODE>&#60;st&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
is the strand of the reading that the tag is placed upon
<DT><CODE>&#60;read&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
is the gel reading name.
<DT><CODE>&#60;pos&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
is the position of the 5' end of &#60;read&#62; in the contig.
<DT><CODE>&#60;distance&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
is the distance of the 5' end from the tag.
