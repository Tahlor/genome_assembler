Tags are used for a variety of purposes and for each function in the
program the user can choose which tag types are currently
"active". Where they are being used to provide visual clues this will
determine which tag types appear in the displays, but for other
functions they can be used to control which parts of the sequence are
omitted from processing. This mode of tag use is called "masking". For
example the program contains a routine to search for repeats, and if any
are found, the user needs to know if such sequence duplications are
caused by incorrect assembly or are genuine repeats. Once the user has
checked a duplication reported by the program and found it to be a
repeat, it can be labelled with a REPT tag. If the repeat routine is run
in masking mode and with REPT tags active, any segment covered by a REPT
tag will not be reported as a match. So once the "problem" has been
dealt with it can be labelled so it is not reported on subsequent
searches. In addition the tag is available to provide annotation for the
completed sequence when it is sent to the data libraries.

A more complicated application of masking is available for two of the
other search procedures in the program: (see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Shotgun assembly</A>) and (see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>). The former
is the general assembly function and the latter is used to find
potential joins between contigs in the database. Below we describe how
masking can be used during assembly and similar comments apply to Find
Internal Joins.

<P>
In the assembly function the user can choose to employ
masking and then select the types of tags to be used as masks. Readings
are compared in two stages: first the program looks for exact matches of
some minimum length and then for each possible overlap it performs an
alignment. If the masking mode is selected the masked regions are not
used during the search for exact matches, but they are used during
alignment. The effect of this is that new readings that would lie
entirely inside masked regions will not produce exact matches and so
will not be entered. However readings that have sufficient data outside
of masked segments can produce matches and will be correctly aligned
even if they overlap the masked data. A common use for masking during
assembly or Find Internal Joins is to avoid finding matches that are
entirely contained in Alu segments.

</P>
<P>
A further mode related to masking is "marking". Marking is available for
the consensus calculation (see section <A HREF="gap5_57.html#SEC95">Consensus calculation</A>) and for Find Internal Joins (see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>). Instead of masking the regions covered by
active tags these routines simply write these sections of the consensus
sequence in lowercase letters. That is they make it easy for users to
see where the tagged segments are. Marking has no other effect.
