<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC11">Introduction to the Restriction Enzyme Map</A></H3>

<P>
The restriction enzyme map function finds and displays restriction sites
within a specified region of a contig. Users can select the enzyme
types to search for and can save the sites found as tags within the
database.

<P>
This figure shows a typical view of the Restriction Enzyme Map
in which the results for each enzyme type have been configured by the
user to be drawn in different colours.  On the left of the display the
enzyme names are shown adjacent to their rows of plotted results. If no
result is found for any particular enzyme eg here APAI, the row will
still be shown so that zero cutters can be identified. Three of the
enzymes types have been selected and are shown highlighted. The results
can be scrolled vertically (and horizontally if the plot is zoomed in).
A ruler is shown along the base and the current cursor position (the 
vertical black line) is shown in the left hand box near the top right of
the display.  If the user clicks, in turn, on two restriction sites
their separation in base pairs will appear in the top right hand box.
Information about the last site touched is shown in the Information line
at the bottom of the display. At the top the edit menu is shown
and can be used to create tags for highlighted enzyme types
(see section <A HREF="gap5_30.html#SEC64">Restriction Enzyme Search</A>).
