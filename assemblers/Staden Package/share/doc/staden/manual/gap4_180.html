This option allows control over computation of the template
status. The validity of a template is computed by checking the size
(based on the locations of assembled readings and position of vector
tags) and the orientation of sequences (based on their "primer type"
values).

The most likely item to need changing is the "size limit scale
factor". The expected range of template sizes for a ligation are
specified in each template record as a minimum-to-maximum
range. Gap4 takes a very simple approach as anything within this range
is valid and anything outside it is invalid. The scale factor is
applied such that the maximum range becomes "max * scale" and the
minimum range becomes "min / scale". So a scale factor of 2 would
adjust a range from 1.0-1.4Kb to 0.5-2.8Kb.

</P>
<P>
The "minimum valid vector tag length" is designed to workaround
problems where some assemblies end up with SVEC tags of 1 or 2 bases
long (which are common when converting from phrap for some
reason). The start and end of a template may be derived from observing
a single reading with sequencing vector at both ends, so the presence
of very short falsely added SVEC tags will mark many templates as
inconsistent.

</P>
<P>
The "Ignore all primer-type values" and "Ignore custom primer-type
values" are methods to disable Gap4's trust in the primer type
information for each sequence. Normally this will be one of
universal-forward, universal-reverse, custom-forward (e.g. from a
primer-walk) and custom-reverse.
