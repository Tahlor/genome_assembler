These are for use in the TEXT segments. None are required, but if any of these
identifiers are present they must confirm to the description below. Much
(currently all) of this list has been taken from the NCBI Trace Archive [2]
documentation. It is duplicated here as the ZTR spec is not tied to the same
revision schedules as the NCBI trace archive (although it is intended that any
suitable updates to the trace archive should be mirrored in this ZTR spec).

</P>
<P>
The Trace Archive specifies a maximum length of values. The ZTR spec does not
have length limitations, but for compatibility these sizes should still be
observed.

</P>
<P>
The Trace Archive also states some identifiers are mandatory; these are marked
by asterisks below. These identifiers are not mandatory in the ZTR spec (but
clearly they need to exist if the data is to be submitted to the NCBI).

</P>
<P>
Finally, some fields are not appropriate for use in the ZTR spec, such as
BASE_FILE (the name of a file containing the base calls). Such fields are
included only for compatibility with the Trace Arhive. It is not expected that 
use of ZTR would allow for the base calls to be read from an external file
instead of the ZTR BASE chunk.
