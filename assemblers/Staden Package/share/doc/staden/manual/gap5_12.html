</P>
<P>
The contig editor displays only one segment of the entire contig,
although several contig editors can be in use at once.  Below the
sequence is a scrollbar and below that a "jog" control. The
scrollbar behaves as expected, allowing rapid positioning anywhere
within the contig using the middle mouse button or left-clicking and
dragging the slider. However with extremely long contigs (for example
100Mb) it can become tricky to move by the desired amount. Each pixel
on the scrollbar may represent 100Kb worth of data, so dragging the
scrollbar is only approximate positioning. Equally so clicking in the
trough to move a screen-full at a time can be too small. This is where
the jog-control can be of use.

</P>
<P>
By default this is always centred. Clicking and dragging this left or
right starts to scroll the editor, at a speed proportional to how far
away from the centre the jog is dragged. Releasing the mouse button
stops automatically scrolling and recentres the jog control.

</P>
<P>
The final, more precise, manner of positioning the editor view is with
the text entry box in the bottom left corner. Type in any coordinate
here and press return to jump straight to that location. Note however
that Gap5's coordinates are currently always in padded form; that is
to say that a gap in the consensus caused by an insertion in one of
the aligned sequences is still counted as a base position.

</P>
<P>
For particularly deep displays the vertical scrollbar on the right
edge of the window will also be useful. While scrolling in X, the
editor attempts to keep the same sequences visible on screen. To do
this it may automatically adjust the Y scrollbar for you due to
changing layout of sequences. (By default the top-most sequence is
always the sequence that starts furthest left and the bottom most is
the sequence starting furthest right.)

</P>
<P>
If you have a mouse wheel, this may also be used for small
scrolling. By itself it scrolls in Y one sequence at a time. With the
Control key held down it scrolls in larger increments. Using the Shift
key in conjunction with the mouse wheel scrolls in X instead, with
Shift+Control to scroll in larger increments.

</P>
<P>
The displayed portion of the contig is separate from the current
location of the editing cursor. This is displayed as a black rectangle
with typically a light coloured letter inside it. Any editing keys
operate on the base underneath this or to the base immediately
preceding it for Delete. We cover the topic of editing later
(see section <A HREF="gap5_14.html#SEC23">Editing</A>), however moving the
editing cursor is also another way of scrolling the editor.

</P>
<P>
Finally the Page Up and Page Down keys scroll the editor left or right
by 90% of current screen width.  Used with Shift the moves in
increments of 1Kb, with Control in increments of 10Kb and with both
Shift and Control in increments of 100Kb. The Home and End keys jump
to the start or end of the current item underneath the editing curosr
- either a sequence or the consensus.
