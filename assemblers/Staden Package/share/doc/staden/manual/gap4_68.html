<P>
In order to put readings and their mutations in context we use a
reference sequence and feature table. This enables mutations to be
reported using positions defined by the reference sequence, and also
allows the effect of the mutations to be noted. To facilitate this gap4
is able to store entries from the EMBL sequence library complete with
their feature tables. These feature tables are converted to gap4
database annotations (tags), which means that they can be selectively
displayed in the template display and editor, and used to translate only
the exons (in the correct reading frame).
The reference sequence can be designated (or reassigned) 
by right clicking on its name. Once set it should
appear labelled "S" at the left edge of the editor.
