<H2><A NAME="SEC175" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC175">Removing Readings and Breaking Contigs</A></H2>

<P>
Occasionally contigs require more drastic changes than simple basecall
edits. Sometimes it is necessary
to remove readings that have been put in the wrong
place, or to break contigs that should not have been joined. Gap4
contains functions to help with these problems, and two
types of interface. 

</P>
<P>
If a contig
needs to be broken cleanly into two new contigs, with all the readings,
other than the two at the incorrect join, still linked together, then
Break Contig 
(see section <A HREF="gap5_51.html#SEC88">Breaking Contigs</A>), or
(see section <A HREF="gap4_62.html#SEC101">Break Contig</A>)
should be used. The former interface is available via the main gap4 Edit
menu, and the latter as an option in the Contig Editor.

</P>
<P>
If one or more readings need removing from from contig(s), even if their
removal will break the contiguity of a contig, then
(see section <A HREF="gap5_52.html#SEC89">Disassemble Readings</A>), or
(see section <A HREF="gap4_62.html#SEC100">Remove Reading</A>)
should be used. The former interface is available via the main gap4 Edit
menu, and the latter as an option in the Contig Editor. Readings can be
removed from the database completely, or moved to start individual new
contigs, one for each reading.

</P>
