Contigs are joined interactively using the Join Editor.  This is
simply a pair of contig editor displays stacked above one another.
The top editor is flipped in Y so that the consensus appears at the
bottom. This allows the two consensus sequences to be adjacent to one
another, separated only by a "differences" line.  Note that it is
essential to align the contigs over the full length of their
overlap. It is much more difficult to achieve this after a join has
been made, and until the alignment is correct, the consensus sequence
will be nonsense.

</P>
<P>
The few differences between the Join Editor and the Contig Editor can be seen
in the figure below. Otherwise all the commands and operations are the
same as those for the Contig Editor

One difference is the Lock button. When set (as it is in the
illustration) scrolling either contig will also scroll the other contig.

</P>
<P>
The Align button aligns the overlapping consensus sequences and adds
pads as necessary. The alignment routine assumes that the two contigs
are already in approximately the right relative position (as they are
immediately after the Join Editor has been invoked from Find Internal
Joins, or Find Repeats). If they are not you may get better results by
manually positioning then before hand.

</P>
<P>
The "&#60;" and "&#62;" buttons either side of the "Align" button
perform the alignment from the editing cursor to the start of the
contig and and from the cursor to the end of the contig
only. Alignment end-gaps are penalised at the curosr position but not
for the alignment end at the contig start/end position. These buttons
are useful for when multiple alignment positions may be valid, such as
is the case with an overlap consisting entirely of a short tandem repeat.

</P>
<P>
It should be noted that each of the pair of editors comprising the
Contig Editor  maintains its own undo history, and using Align
is likely to add to both undo histories. There is only one Undo
button, but it applies to the editor last clicked within. A hint is
given as to which of the two editors this is by highlighting the
editor in a red border when the mouse is moved over the Undo button.

</P>
<P>
Pressing the Join button will display a small dialogue box informing
you of the length and percentage match of the overlap between the two
contigs. At this point you can decide to make the join, to not make
the join (both of which remove the editors from the screen) or to
cancel which leaves the join editor visible still to permit further
editing.

</P>
