This method is used to find regions of a  sequence  that
code  for  a
protein.  It is based  on  the method of Fickett <CITE>Fickett,J. (1982) 
Nucl. Acid Res.10</CITE>, and unlike the other methods currently in the
package does not attempt to say either which strand or frame is likely
to be coding, only which regions of the sequence.

</P>
<P>
The method looks for sections of the sequence in which the
frequencies at which  each  of  the  four  bases  occupy  the  three
positions  in  codons  is  nonrandom.  The level of nonrandomness is
plotted on a scale that shows the probability that the  sequence  is
coding.  At each position along a sequence the calculation gives the
same value for all six possible reading frames, so only one value is
plotted. Seventy six percent of coding regions score above 0.78  and
76% of noncoding regions below 0.78. 
No known window in a
coding region has a value below 0.4, but 14% of windows in noncoding
sequences  score  below  it. No known window in a noncoding region
reaches a score of 1.34, but this score is reached by 16%  of  known  coding
regions. These statements are now very much out of date.

The method was first described in  <CITE>Staden R. (1984) 
Nucl. Acid Res.  12, 551-567</CITE>.
It looks through the sequence in one  fixed  phase  and  counts  the
number  of  times  each  base  appears  in  each  of  the three codon
positions: for each window position it counts A1,A2,A3 and  C1,C2,C3
and  G1,G2,G3  and  T1,T2,T3  and calculates AMEAN=(A1+A2+A3)/3, and
similarly CMEAN, GMEAN and TMEAN; it  then  calculates  ADIF=abs(A1-
AMEAN)+abs(A2-AMEAN)+abs(A3-AMEAN) and similarly CDIF, GDIF and TDIF
to measure the differences  between  an  even  base  usage  for  all
positions  in  the  codons  and the observed usage. The routine then
calculates and plots the sum ADIF+CDIF+GDIF+TDIF.

In the figure shown below it will be seen that much of the sequence
being analysed appears to be coding, and this is indeed the case. Many
of the troughs between peaks correspond to the ends of genes in this
E. coli sequence (which was not a good choice to illustrate the
method!). The horizontal line is at 76%. 76% of coding regions achieve values
above this line and 76% of noncoding regions achieve scores below the line.

<P>
As can be seen in the dialogue below 
the user can set the window length in codons (although around 67 codons is
generally suitable) and can restrict the search to a sub region of the
sequence. Note that the window length must be odd.
