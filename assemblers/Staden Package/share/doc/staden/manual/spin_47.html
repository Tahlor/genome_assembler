A sequence display is associated with a single set of results 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_48.html#SEC73">Result manager</A>). To invoke a Sequence 
Comparison Display, bring up a pop
up menu for the required result, either from the Results manager, the Results
menu in the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot, or the coloured square icon on the right of the spin
plot. From the menu, select the "Display sequences" option.

<P>
The horizontal sequence is drawn above the vertical sequence. In the
picture above, "hsproperd" is the horizontal sequence and "mmproper" is
the vertical sequence. The central panel indicates characters which are
identical between the horizontal and vertical sequences. The buttons to
the left of the sequences allow scrolling of the sequences either 1 character
at a time (&#60; or &#62;) or a screen width (&#60;&#60; or &#62;&#62;). Pressing the Lock
button "locks" the two sequences together and they can be scrolled as
one.  Movement of the sequences is also controlled by the scrollbars or by
moving the corresponding cursor in the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_45.html#SEC66">SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot</A>). The black cursors in the sequence display 
correspond to the position of the cursor in the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot. The sequences can be
made to 'jump' to the nearest match in those results by pressing the 
"Nearest match" or "Nearest dot" buttons. Nearest match means the match
whose x,y coordinate in sequence character positions is closest, whereas
Nearest dot means the match which appears closest in screen
coordinates. If the display edges were proportional to the sequence
lengths the Nearest dot and Nearest match would be equivalent.
