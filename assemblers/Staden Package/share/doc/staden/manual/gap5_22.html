The purpose of this menu is to configure the operation of the contig
editor. Settings can be saved using the "Save settings" button, which
also saves preferences for the editor width and height and the location
of the divider between the names and sequence panels. It does not save
tag macros though; these may be saved separately using the "Save
Macros" option. Settings for the following options can be changed.

<!-- NODE:Editor-Group Readings -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC47">Group Readings</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>

</P>
<P>
Sequences have an "X" location in the editor defined by the location
within the contig that they align to. The "Y" location though is
determined by the sequence layout algorithm, governed by the Pack
Sequences setting and Group Readings options.

</P>
<P>
By default sequences are grouped into distinct technologies, typically
with longer sequences up the top (capillary) and shorter ones at the
bottom (Illumina, SOLiD).  Within these technology groups the sequences
are then sorted by their start location, so the top-most sequences start
earlier and the bottom most sequences start later.

</P>
<P>
The Group Readings menu allows user control over these primary and
secondary collating orders. The sorting methods are defined below.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>By technology
<DD>
Sorted in order of unknown, sanger (capillary), Illumina, SOLiD, 454.

<DT>By clipped start
<DD>
Sorted by the visible (non-cutoff) start position.

<DT>By start
<DD>
Sorted by the start position, regardless of whether the base is in
cutoff data or not.

<DT>By template
<DD>
Sorted by template name. In Gap5 this is always defined to be a prefix
of the sequence name, or optionally the same as the sequence name. The
sorting method is using a simple ASCII collation order.

<DT>By strand
<DD>
Sorts data into the top strand first followed by the bottom strand data.

<DT>By base
<DD>
This sort order is different from all others in that it depends on the
location of the editor cursor.

Sorts sequences by the base type overlapping the last editor cursor
location in the consensus. The collation order is A, C, G, T, N and *.
Sequences that do not overlap that consensus location or those that only
overlap in the cutoff portion are not sorted by this method. If this is
used as the primary sort then these other sequences will be sorted using
the secondary sort. If the secondary sort is By Base then an implicit
tertiary sort order of By Start is used.

Note that moving the editing cursor around sequences will not update the
Y order. Only placement of the editing cursor on the consensus will
update this.

<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC48">Highlight Disagreements</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>

</P>
<P>
This toggles between the normal sequence display (showing the current base
assignments) and one in which those assignments that differ from the consensus
are highlighted. It makes scanning for problems by eye much easier.

</P>
<P>
Several modes of highlighting are available: "By dots" will only display the
bases that differ from the consensus, displaying all other bases as full
stops if they match or colons if they mismatch but are poor
quality. The definition of poor quality here can be adjusted using the
"Set quality threshold" option of the Settings menu. The base
colours are as normal (ie reflecting tags and quality).

</P>
<P>
Highlight disagreements "By foreground colour" and "By background
colour" displays all base characters, but colours those that differ
from the consensus. Bases which differ by are below the
difference quality threshold are shaded in light blue while high
quality differences are dark blue. This allows easier
visual scanning of the context that a difference occurs in, but it may
be wise to disable the displaying of tags (hint: control-Q toggles
tags on and off).

</P>
<P>
Finally the "Case sensitive" toggle controls whether upper and lower
case bases of the same base type should be considered as differences.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Pack Sequences -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC49">Pack Sequences</A></H3>

<P>
This controls whether the editor allocates one row per sequence or
whether it is permitted to pack multiple sequences onto a single row,
assuming they do not overlap.

</P>
<P>
The latter allows for a more compact plot which is desirable when
dealing with short sequences, however it has the side effect that the
reading names can no longer be listed in the names panel to the left.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Editor-Hide Annotations -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC50">Hide Annotations</A></H3>

<P>
Sometimes we need to see the background shading underneath an
annotation, for example to see the base quality or if we have
Highlight Disagreements turned on using the <I>by background colour</I>
mode. This option simply hides all annotations from display until it
is selected again to reveal them once more.

</P>
<P>
The Control-Q keyboard shortcut has the same effect.
