This option can be invoked from the main gap4 View menu, in which case
it appears as a single plot, or from the View menu of the Consistency Display
in which case it will appear as part of the Consistency Display.

</P>
<P>
The display is used to show which regions of the data are covered by
readings from each of the two strands of the DNA. 
A separate line is drawn for each strand: forward in red and reverse
in black.
The function works in two complementary modes: it can plot the positions
which are covered, or the positions which are not. The latter is probably
the most useful as it directs users to the places requiring further data.

</P>
<P>
The figure below shows the covered positions, and the figure below that
shows the uncovered positions for the same contig.

<P>
The plot can be regarded as a coarse version of the Quality Plot
(see section <A HREF="gap4_33.html#SEC41">Quality Plot</A>),
in that it shows the strand coverage using the Quality Calculation
(see section <A HREF="gap5_63.html#SEC101">The Quality Calculation</A>),
but does not reveal problems with individual base positions.

</P>

The dialogue allows user to select the contig(s) and strands to analyse
and whether to plot Coverage or Problems.
