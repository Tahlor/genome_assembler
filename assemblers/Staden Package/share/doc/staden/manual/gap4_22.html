Contigs can be selected by either clicking with the left mouse button
on the line representing the required contig in the contig selector window
or alternatively by choosing the "List contigs" option from the "View" menu. 
This option invokes a "Contig List" list box where the contig names and 
numbers are listed in the same order as they appear in the contig selector 
window. 

</P>

<p>

<P>
Within this list box the contig names can be sorted 
alphabetically on contig name or numerically on contig number. This is done 
by selecting the corresponding item from the sort 
menu at the top of the list box. Clicking on a name within the list box is 
equivalent to clicking on the corresponding contig in the contig selector.
More than one contig can be selected by dragging out a region with the left
mouse button. Dragging the mouse off the bottom of the list will scroll it to
allow selection of a range larger than the displayed section of the
list.  When the left button is pressed any existing selection is
cleared. To select several disjoint entries in the list press control
and the left mouse button.  The "Copy" button copies the current
selection to the paste buffer.

</P>
<P>
Most commands require a contig identifier (which can be the name or
number of any reading on the contig) and gap4 contains several
mechanisms for obtaining this information from users.  The names or
numbers can be typed or cut and pasted into dialogue boxes (note that a
reading number must be preceded by a # character, e.g.  "#102" means
reading number 102 but "102" means the reading with name
102).

</P>
<P>
Also any
currently active dialogue boxes that require a contig to be selected can
be updated simply by clicking on a contig in the contig selector or clicking
on an entry in the "Contig Names" list box.  For
example, if the Edit contig command is selected from the Edit menu it
will bring up a dialogue requesting the identity of the contig to edit.
If the user clicks the left mouse button on a contig in the contig
selector window, the contig editor dialogue will automatically change to
contain the name of the selected contig.  Some commands, such as the
Contig Editor, can be selected from a popup menu that is activated by
clicking the right mouse button on the contig line in the Contig
Selector or clicking the right mouse button on the corresponding name within
the "Contig List" list box. This simultaneously defines the contig to 
operate on and so the command starts up without dialogue.

</P>
<P>
Several contigs can be selected at once by either clicking on each
contig with the left mouse button or dragging out a selection rectangle
by holding the left mouse button down. Contigs which are entirely
enclosed within the rectangle will be selected. Alternatively, selecting
several contigs from the "Contig Names" list box will also result in each
contig being selected. Selected contigs are highlighted in bold. Selecting
the same contig again will unselect it.

</P>
<P>
The currently selected contigs are also kept in a 'list' named contigs.
