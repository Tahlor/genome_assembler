This function is used to remove readings from a database or move
readings to new contigs.

<P>
If readings are removed from the database all reference to them is
deleted. If a reading is moved to a "single-read contig" a new
contig will be created containing this one single reading, which may
then be re-processed by Find Internal Joins
(see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>) 
and the Join editor
(see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">The Join Editor</A>), which should
reveal all the other positions at which the reading matches.

</P>
<P>
More useful is the general "Move readings to new contigs". This will
keep any assembly relationships intact between the set of readings to
be disassembled. For example if three readings overlap then when
disassembled all three will end up in a single new contig. This
function is particularly useful for pulling apart false joins or
repeats.

</P>
<P>
The set of readings to be processed can be read from a "file" or a "list" and
clicking on the "browse" button will invoke an appropriate browser. If just a
single reading is to be assembled choose "single" and enter the
reading name instead of the file or list of filenames.

</P>
<P>
Removal via a "list" is a particularly powerful option when
controlled via the list generation functions within the contig
editor. For example break contig could be viewed as disassembling a
list of readings selected using "Select this reading and all to
right".

</P>
<P>
Unlike gap4, gap5 can cope with having holes in contigs. (This is
obviously a requirement when dealing with mapped alignments.)  Hence
gap5 gives us a choice whether to break contigs into two (or more)
pieces when removing sequences produces holes in the contigs. By
default this is enabled.
