This option can be invoked from the main gap4 View menu, in which case
it appears as a single plot, or from the View menu of the Template
Display, in which case it will appear as part of the Template Display.

</P>
<P>
For each base in the consensus a "quality" code
is computed based on the accuracy of 
the data on each strand and whether or not the two strands agree. In a
future release it will be renamed the "Strand Comparison Plot"
This "quality" is then plotted using colour and 
height to distinguish the quality codes shown below.

</P>

<PRE>
Colour  Height          Meaning

grey    0 to 0          OK on both strands, both agree
blue    0 to 1          OK on plus strand only
green  -1 to 0          OK on minus strand only
red    -1 to 1          Bad on both strands
black  -2 to 2          OK on both strands but they disagree

<P>
For example, in the figure we see that the first four hundred or so
bases are mostly only well determined on the forward strand.

</P>
<P>
Note that when displaying many bases the screen resolution implies that the
quality codes for many bases will appear in the same screen pixel.  However
the use of varying heights ensures that all problematic regions will be
visible, even when the problem is only with a single base position. Hence when
the quality plot consists of a single grey line all known quality problems
have been resolved, at the current consensus and quality cutoffs. 

</P>
<P>
The quality plot appears as "Calculate quality" in the Results Manager window
(see section <A HREF="gap5_68.html#SEC106">Results Manager</A>).

</P>
<P>
Within the Results Manager commands available, using the right mouse
button, include "Information",
which lists a summary of
the distribution of quality types to the output window, and "List" which lists
the actual quality values for each base to the output window. These quality
values are written in a textual form of single letters per base and are listed
below.
