This method is used to find segments of a sequence that might code for tRNAs.
It looks  for  potential cloverleaf forming structures and then for the
presence of the expected conserved bases. It presents  results  graphically
and draws out the cloverleafs.
 
The algorithm uses a large number of parameters including some loop
lengths, scores for each of the four stems, and scores for the conserved
bases, but we have not yet included an interface for setting these. We
apologise for this and plan to add the interface in a future release. 
Using individual base pair scores of A-T = G-C = 2, G-T = 1, 
in its present form the algorithm is set to search for segments of
sequence satisfying the following minimum scores:

<LI>aminoacyl stem 12

<LI>minimum total stem score 36

<LI>minimum number of conserved bases 16

<LI>no introns

The algorithm was first described in <CITE>Staden,R. (1980)
A computer program to search for tRNA genes. Nucl. Acid Res 8, 
817-825</CITE>, but has been completely rewritten since then.
The tRNAs  that  have been  sequenced  so far have two
characteristics that can be used to locate their genes  within  long
DNA  sequences.  Firstly they  have  a common   secondary  structure
-  the  cloverleaf  -  and  secondly, particular bases almost always
appear  at  certain  positions  in the cloverleaf.   The  cloverleaf
is composed of four base-paired stems and four loops.  Three of  the
stems are  of  fixed  length  but  the fourth,  the  dhu  stem which
usually has four base pairs, sometimes has only three.  All  of  the
loops  can  vary in size.   The  following relationships between the
stems in the cloverleaf are assumed in the program:  (a)  there  are
no  bases  between  one  end   of   the  aminoacyl  stem   and   the
adjoining tuc stem;  (b) there are two bases between  the  aminoacyl
stem and the dhu stem;  (c) there is one base between the  dhu  stem
and the anticodon stem;  (d) there are at least three bases  between
the  anticodon  stem  and the tuc stem.  The program looks first for
cloverleaf structure and then for  conserved  bases.
 
The output shows the position of the possible gene in the
sequence by a vertical line the height of which shows the number  of
basepairs  made in the stems. Typical graphical output:
