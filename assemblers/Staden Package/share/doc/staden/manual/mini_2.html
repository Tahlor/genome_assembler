<P>
This manual describes the sequence handling and analysis software
developed at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular
Biology, Cambridge, UK, which has come to be known as the Staden
Package.

</P>
<P>
The vast bulk of work on the package was done at LMB within Rodger
Staden's group, which over time has consisted of Tim Gleeson, Simon
Dear, James Bonfield, Kathryn Beal, Mark Jordan and Yaping
Cheng. Besides the group members a number of people have made
important contributions; most notably including David Judge and John
Taylor for feedback / tutorials and developing the Windows release
respectively.

</P>
<P>
Since mid-2003 the group in LMB no longer exists. The package became
"open source" and moved onto SourceForge in early 2004. The only
active maintainer (James Bonfield) now works at the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute. The new package homepage may be found at

</P>
<P>
http://staden.sourceforge.net/
 and the SourceForge project page
is at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/staden/
.

</P>
<P>
The focus of the development since 1990 has been to produce improved
methods for processing the data for large scale sequencing projects,
and this is reflected in the scope of the package: the most advanced
components (trev, prefinish, pregap4 and gap4) are those used in that
area.  Nevertheless the package also contains a program (spin) for the
analysis and comparison of finished sequences. The latter also
provides a graphical user interface to EMBOSS.

</P>
<P>
Since the LMB group disbanded it has become necessary to reduce the
scope of further development, so active work is primarily being
directed to the Gap4 program.

</P>
<P>
Gap4 performs sequence assembly, contig ordering based on read pair
data, contig joining based on sequence comparisons, assembly checking,
repeat searching, experiment suggestion, read pair analysis and contig
editing. It has graphical views of contigs, templates, readings and
traces which all scroll in register. Contig editor searches and
experiment suggestion routines use confidence values to calculate the
confidence of the consensus sequence and hence identify only places
requiring visual trace inspection or extra data. The result is
extremely rapid finishing and a consensus of known accuracy.

</P>
<P>
Pregap4 provides a graphical user interface to set up the processing
required to prepare trace data for assembly or analysis. It also
automates these processes. The possible processes which can be set up
and automated include trace format conversion, quality analysis,
vector clipping, contaminant screening, repeat searching and mutation
detection.

</P>
<P>
Trev is a rapid and flexible viewer and editor for ABI, ALF, SCF and
ZTR trace files.

</P>
<P>
Prefinish analyses partially completed sequence assemblies and
suggests the most efficient set of experiments to help finish the
project.

</P>
<P>
Tracediff and hetscan automatically locate mutations by comparing
trace data against reference traces. They annotate the mutations found
ready for viewing in gap4.

</P>

<P>
Spin analyses nucleotide sequences to find genes, restriction sites,
motifs, etc. It can perform translations, find open reading frames,
count codons, etc. Many results are presented graphically and a
sliding sequence window is linked to the graphics cursor.  Spin also
compares pairs of sequences in many ways.  It has very rapid dot
matrix analysis, global and local alignment algorithms, plus a sliding
sequence window linked to the graphical plots. It can compare nucleic
acid against nucleic acid, protein against protein, and protein
against nucleic acid.

</P>

<P>
The manual describes, in turn, each of the main programs in the
package: gap4, and then pregap4 and its associated programs such as
trev, and then spin.  This is followed by a description of the
graphical user interface, the ZTR, SCF and Experiment file formats
used by our software, UNIX manpages for several of the smaller
programs, and finally a list of papers published about the software.
The description for each of the programs includes an introductory
section which is intended to be sufficient to enable people to start
using them, although in order to get the most from the programs, and
to find the most efficient ways of using them we recommend that the
whole manual is read once. The mini-manual is made up from the
introductory sections for each of the main programs.
