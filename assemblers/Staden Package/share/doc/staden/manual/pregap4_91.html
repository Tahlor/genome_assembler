<H2><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="pregap4_toc.html#SEC98">An Overview of a Module</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>

</P>
<P>
A pregap4 module is a single file containing a series of functions with
predefined interfaces. Pregap4 uses these functions to communicate with module.

</P>
<P>
This section is for system managers and programmers only.

</P>

<P>
The module itself is written using the Tcl/Tk language. A definition of this
language is outside the scope of this manual, however several books exist on
the subject. Each modules executes inside a Tcl "namespace". This means that
modules may make use of global variables and global function names without
fear of clashing with other modules. Indeed the use of specific function names
and global variables is of considerable importance for designing a new module.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Pregap4-WritingMods-Functions -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="pregap4_toc.html#SEC99">Functions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>

</P>
<P>
The basic structure of a module is that it has a series of known functions
which pregap4 expects to use. Some of these functions are mandatory, whilst
others will only be called by pregap4 if they have been defined.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>name</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX338"></A>
    Mandatory.

    Arguments: none

    Returns:   The textual name of the module.

    This function is used to query a human readable name for the module
    (eg "ALF/ABI to SCF Conversion"). This name is used in the module list
    at the left side of the pregap4 window.
<P>

<DT><VAR>init</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX339"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: None

    Returns:   None

    This sets up any data structures needed for this module. It can be
    used for providing defaults for global variables when they are not
    known (eg they have no settings in the system or user pregap4rc files)
    and for setting up any other data structures required.
<P>

<DT><VAR>run</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX340"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: A Tcl list of files to process

    Returns:   A new Tcl list of files for subsequent processing.

    This is the main work horse. It is optional, however in all but the
        most esoteric cases, it will be needed.

    The single argument is a Tcl list of sequence names. These are either
    filenames on disk or identifiers used for fetching data from a
    database. The module should loop through the sequences which it can
    process (which may not be all of them, depending on the known
    information and file types).

    When finished, it needs to return a new list of files. If a file has
    been rejected by this module (eg it is completely sequencing vector)
    then this sequence name should be omitted from the returned list.
    However do make sure that all failed files have an error string
    attached to them by setting the file_error(seq name) array element.
<P>

<DT><VAR>shutdown</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX341"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: A Tcl list of files to process

    Returns:   A new Tcl list of files for subsequent processing.

    Deallocates any data structures that have been setup during the init
    or run stages. Most modules will not need this function. As with the
    run module, the returned value should be the list of passed files,
    which is generally the same as the list passed into this function.

    A special module, which is always included by pregap4, is the
    shutdown.p4m module. This is always the last module to have shutdown
    called. It produces the reports for pregap4 and does some general house
    keeping.
<P>

<DT><VAR>create_dialogue</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: A tk pathname

    Returns:   None

    This create a dialogue controlling the parameters for this module. The
    tk pathname passed into this function should be the root for all
    components of this dialogue. (Note though that this is not a toplevel
    window, but a subwindow of the main pregap4 dialogue.)
<P>

<DT><VAR>check_params</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX343"></A>
        Optional.

        Arguments: None

        Returns:   A variable name or a blank string.

        This checks that this module has valid answers to all of its
        mandatory questions. If this is the case a blank string is returned,
        otherwise the first variable name which needs a value is returned.
<P>

<DT><VAR>process_dialogue</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX344"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: A tk pathname

    Returns:   0 for failure, 1 for success

    This is executed in all modules before the run functions are executed.
    It's purpose is to extract any information from user editable entries
    or checkboxes ready for the run function to utilise. It may also be
    used to check that the data entered is valid.

    The return code is used to indicate whether this module has sufficient
    data to execute. If 0 is returned pregap4 will beep and make sure that
    the dialogue 'tab' for this module is displayed. Further processing
    then stops until the 'Run' button is pressed again.

    For instance if a module needs to know the sequencing vector to screen
    against, then this should check if the value has been entered or can
    be obtained via a command. If so it returns 1.
<P>

<DT><VAR>configure_dialogue path mode</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX345"></A>
    Optional.

    Arguments: A tk pathname, the configure mode

    Returns:   None

    If this function is present pregap4 will add a button to the top of the
    module dialogue inviting the user to save the parameters for this
        module to the configuration file.

        In early releases of pregap4 (2000.0 and before) a "Select parameters
        to save" button was also available. To maintain compatibility with
        older modules the "mode" parameter is still used. If you wish the
        module to be backwards compatible with old pregap4 releases then this
        needs to be checked to make sure that it contains "save_all". If it
        does not then no action should be taken. In the 2001 release and newer
        the "mode" parameter will always contain "save_all" so no check is
        required.

        To save the dialogue information this function should use the pregap4
        mod_save and glob_save functions.
</DL>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-WritingMods-Module Variables -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="pregap4_toc.html#SEC100">Module Variables</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX346"></A>
<A NAME="IDX347"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>mandatory</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX348"></A>
    The existence of this variable (set to anything) states that this
    module cannot be disabled.
<P>

<DT><VAR>hidden</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX349"></A>

The existence of this variable states that its name shall not appear
    in the module list (although it will still be used).
<P>

<DT><VAR>report</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>
    The contents of this variable are displayed at the end of the pregap
    run by the shutdown.p4m module.
</DL>

<!-- NODE:Pregap4-WritingMods-Global Variables -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="pregap4_toc.html#SEC101">Global Variables</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX351"></A>
<A NAME="IDX352"></A>

</P>
<P>
Several global variables exist which may need to be updated within the
modules. For successful operation it is required to update these when
applicable.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>file_type</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX353"></A>
This is a Tcl array indexed by file name. It is initialised by the General
Configuration module to be one of <CODE>ABI</CODE>, <CODE>ALF</CODE>, <CODE>EXP</CODE>,
<CODE>PLN</CODE>, <CODE>SCF</CODE> or <CODE>UNK</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><VAR>file_error</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX354"></A>
This is a global array indexed by the current file name. If a file has been
rejected by a module (ie not returned from the <CODE>run</CODE> function) then
the appropriate array element must be filled with a reason. Typically the
format for this reason will start with the module name followed by a colon.
For example "makeSCF: unknown file type".
<P>

<DT><VAR>file_id</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX355"></A>
This is a global array, indexed by filenames, containing the sequence
identifiers (which are often different to the sequence filenames). It is
initialised by the General Configuration module.
<P>

<DT><VAR>file_orig_name</VAR>
<DD>
This is a global array holding any original filename for each currently
processed file. It is initialised by the General Configuration module such
that each file points to its own filename.
</DL>

<P>
When creating and returning a new file (such as when switching from SCF files
to Experiment Files in the Initialise Experiment Files module) it is required
that the arrays are all updated correctly. This involves creating new array
elements for each of the above four arrays. The <VAR>file_type</VAR> array element,
indexed by a new name should contain the new file type (eg <CODE>set
file_type(seq10.exp) EXP</CODE>). The <VAR>file_error</VAR> array element should be set
to a blank string. The <VAR>file_id</VAR> should inherit the sequence identifier
from the original file (eg <CODE>set file_id(seq10.exp) $file_id(seq10.scf)</CODE>).
The <VAR>file_orig_name</VAR> array element should point to the old filename (not
the original filename pointed to by the old filename). In this way
<VAR>file_orig_name</VAR> could be considered as a list of the intermediate files
generated for each final sequence file.

<A NAME="IDX356"></A>

</P>
<P>
Apologies, but this section of documentation is still unfinished.

</P>
<P>
The full definition of these functions may be found in the Tcl code for
Pregap4 itself. It is recommended that you use the Unix <CODE>grep</CODE> utility to
find the definitions and example uses.

The best examples are the existing modules. Try looking at the Compress Trace
Files module as an example. This may be found in
<TT>`$STADENROOT/lib/pregap4/modules/compress_trace.p4m'</TT>.
