<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC63">Moving the visible segment of the contig</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>

<P>
The contig editor displays only one segment of the entire contig, although
several contig editors can be in use at once.  Above the sequence display
is a "scrollbar". This line represents the entire contig, with a greyed
section representing the currently displayed segment. To change the
displayed segment put the mouse cursor in the scrollbar and use the mouse
buttons. The available controls are:

</P>

<PRE>
Middle Mouse Button      Set displayed section
Alt Left Mouse Button    Set displayed section
Left Mouse Button        Scroll left or right one screenful
</PRE>

<P>
On the far right side of the contig is a vertically oriented scrollbar.
Typically the editor will be showing all available data, in which case the
vertical scrollbar cannot be scrolled. In regions of exceptionally deep
coverage, the editor makes sure that the controls, the consensus, and any
status lines are visible. The remaining space is taken up with however many
sequences fit. The vertical scrollbar can then be used, using the mouse buttons
listed above, to scroll through the sequences.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the scrollbars there are four buttons on the
left hand side for scrolling by fixed amounts.

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;&#60;              Scroll left half a screenful
&#60;               Scroll left one base
&#62;               Scroll right one base
&#62;&#62;              Scroll right half a screenful
</PRE>

<P>
Within the editor window itself two more key combinations can be used
for scrolling forwards and backwards an entire screenful. These, and
several others, are modelled after the <CODE>Emacs</CODE> key bindings.

</P>

<PRE>
Control v       Scroll right one screenful
Meta v          Scroll left one screenful
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, moving the editing cursor will always adjust the displayed
section so that the editing cursor is visible. Hence this can also be
used to scroll around the editor in both horizontal and vertical fashions.

</P>
