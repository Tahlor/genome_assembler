<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC28">Chunk Types</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>

</P>
<P>
As described above, each chunk has a type. The format of the data contained in 
the chunk data field (when written in format 0) is described below.
Note that no chunks are mandatory. It is valid to have no chunks at all.
However some chunk types may depend on the existance of others. This will be
indicated below, where applicable.

</P>
<P>
Each chunk type is stored as a 4-byte value. Bit 5 of the first byte is used
to indicate whether the chunk type is part of the public ZTR spec (bit 5 of
first byte == 0) or is a private/custom type (bit 5 of first byte == 1). Bit
5 of the remaining 3 bytes is reserved - they must always be set to zero.

</P>
<P>
Practically speaking this means that public chunk types consist entirely of
upper case letters (eg TEXT) whereas private chunk types start with a
lowercase letter (eg tEXT). Note that in this example TEXT and tEXT are
completely independent types and they may have no more relationship with each
other than (for example) TEXT and BPOS types.

</P>
<P>
It is valid to have multiples of some chunks (eg text chunks), but not for
others (such as base calls). The order of chunks does not matter unless
explicitly specified.

</P>
<P>
A chunk may have meta-data associated with it. This is data about the data
chunk. For example the data chunk could be a series of 16-bit trace samples,
while the meta-data could be a label attached to that trace (to distinguish
trace A from traces C, G and T). Meta-data is typically very small and so it
is never need be compressed in any of the public chunk types (although
meta-data is specific to each chunk type and so it would be valid to have
private chunks with compressed meta-data if desirable).

</P>
<P>
The first byte of each chunk data when uncompressed must be zero, indicating
raw format. If, having read the chunk data, this is not the case then the
chunk needs decompressing or reverse filtering until the first byte is
zero. There may be a few padding bytes between the format byte and the first
element of real data in the chunk. This is to make file processing simpler
when the chunk data consists of 16 or 32-bit words; the padding bytes ensure
that the data is aligned to the appropriate word size. Any padding bytes
required will be listed in the appopriate chunk definition below.

</P>

<P>
The following lists the chunk types available in 32-bit big-endian format.
In all cases the data is presented in the uncompressed form, starting with the 
raw format byte and any appropriate padding.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC29">SAMP</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3
            +--+--+--+--+
Hex values  | data name |
            +--+--+--+--+

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7       N
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+
Hex values  | 0| 0| data| data| data|   -   |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+
</PRE>

<P>
This encodes a series of 16-bit trace samples. The first data byte is the
format (raw); the second data byte is present for padding purposes only. After 
that comes a series of 16-bit big-endian values.

</P>
<P>
The meta-data for this chunk contains a 4-byte name associated with the
trace. If a name is shorter than 4 bytes then it should be right padded with
nul characters to 4 bytes. For sequencing traces the four lanes representig A, 
C, G and T signals have names "A\0\0\0", "C\0\0\0", "G\0\0\0" and "T\0\0\0".

</P>
<P>
At present other names are not reserved, but it is recommended that (for
consistency with elsewhere) you label private trace arrays with names starting 
in a lowercase letter (specifically, bit 5 is 1).

</P>
<P>
For sequencing traces it is expected that there will be four SAMP chunks,
although the order is not specified.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC30">SMP4</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7       N
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+
Hex values  | 0| 0| data| data| data|   -   |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+
</PRE>

<P>
The first byte is 0 (raw format). Next is a single padding byte (also 0).
Then follows a series of 2-byte big-endian trace samples for the "A" trace,
followed by a series of 2-byte big-endian traces samples for the "C" trace,
also followed by the "G" and "T" traces (in that order). The assumption is
made that there is the same number of data points for all traces and hence the 
length of each trace is simply the number of data elements divided by four.

</P>
<P>
This chunk is mutually exclusive with the SAMP chunks. If both sets are
defined then the last found in the file should be used. Experimentation has
shown that this gives around 3% saving over 4 separate SAMP chunks.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC31">BASE</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3      N  
            +--+--+--+--  -  --+
Hex values  | 0| base calls    |
            +--+--+--+--  -  --+
</PRE>

<P>
The first byte is 0 (raw format). This is followed by the base calls in ASCII
format (one base per byte). The base call case an encoding set should be IUPAC
characters [1].

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC32">BPOS</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7       
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+--+--+--+--+
Hex values  | 0| padding|   data    |   -   |    data   |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-     -+--+--+--+--+
</PRE>

<P>
This chunk contains the mapping of base call (BASE) numbers to sample (SAMP)
numbers; it defines the position of each base call in the trace data. The
position here is defined as the numbering of the 16-bit positions held in the
SAMP array, counting zero as the first value.

</P>
<P>
The format is 0 (raw format) followed by three padding bytes (all 0). Next
follows a series of 4-byte big-endian numbers specifying the position of each
base call as an index into the sample arrays (when considered as a 2-byte
array with the format header stripped off).

</P>
<P>
Excluding the format and padding bytes, the number of 4-byte elements should
be identical to the number of base calls. All sample numbers are counted from
zero. No sample number in BPOS should be beyond the end of the SAMP arrays
(although it should not be assumed that the SAMP chunks will be before this
chunk). Note that the BPOS elements may not be totally in sorted order as
the base calls may be shifted relative to one another due to compressions.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC33">CNF4</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1              N              4N
            +--+--+--   -   --+--+----- -  -----+
Hex values  | 0| call confidence | A/C/G/T conf |
            +--+--+--   -   --+--+----- -  -----+

(N == number of bases in BASE chunk)
</PRE>

<P>
The first byte of this chunk is 0 (raw format). This is then followed by a
series confidence values for the called base. Next comes all the remaining
confidence values for A, C, G and T excluding those that have already been
written (ie the called base). So for a sequence AGT we would store confidences
A1 G2 T3 C1 G1 T1 A2 C2 T2 A3 C3 G3.

</P>
<P>
The purpose of this is to group the (likely) highest confidence value (those
for the called base) at the start of the chunk followed by the remaining
values. Hence if phred confidence values are written in a CNF4 chunk the first
quarter of chunk will consist of phred confidence values and the last three
quarters will (assuming no ambiguous base calls) consist entirely of zeros.

</P>
<P>
For the purposes of storage the confidence value for a base call that is not
A, C, G or T (in any case) is stored as if the base call was T.

</P>
<P>
The confidence values should be from the "-10 * log10 (1-probability)". These
values are then converted to their nearest integral value.
If a program wishes to store confidence values in a different range then this
should be stored in a different chunk type.

</P>
<P>
If this chunk exists it must exist after a BASE chunk.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC34">TEXT</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:	      0 
            +--+-  -  -+--+-  -  -+--+-     -+-  -  -+--+-  -  -+--+--+
Hex values  | 0| ident | 0| value | 0|   -   | ident | 0| value | 0| 0|
            +--+-  -  -+--+-  -  -+--+-     -+-  -  -+--+-  -  -+--+--+
</PRE>

<P>
This contains a series of "identifier\0value\0" pairs.

</P>
<P>
The identifiers and values may be any length and may contain any data except
the nul character. The nul character marks the end of the identifier or the
end of the value. Multiple identifier-value pairs are allowable, with a double 
nul character marking the end of the list.

</P>
<P>
Identifiers starting with bit 5 clear (uppercase) are part of the public ZTR
spec. Any public identifier not listed as part of this spec should be
considered as reserved. Identifiers that have bit 6 set (lowercase) are for
private use and no restriction is placed on these.

</P>
<P>
See below for the text identifier list.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC35">CLIP</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
Hex values  | 0| left clip | right clip|
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
</PRE>

<P>
This contains suggested quality clip points. These are stored as zero (raw
data) followed by a 4-byte big endian value for the left clip point and a
4-byte big endian value for the right clip point. Clip points are defined in
units of base calls, with a value of 1 clipping the first base (so zero
indicates no left clip and NumberOfBases+1 indicates no right clip).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC36">CR32</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1  2  3  4 
            +--+--+--+--+--+
Hex values  | 0|   CRC-32  |
            +--+--+--+--+--+
</PRE>

<P>
This chunk is always just 4 bytes of data containing a CRC-32 checksum,
computed according to the widely used ANSI X3.66 standard. If present, the
checksum will be a check of all of the data since the last CR32 chunk.
This will include checking the header if this is the first CR32 chunk, and
including the previous CRC32 chunk if it is not. Obviously the checksum will
not include checks on this CR32 chunk.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="formats_toc.html#SEC37">COMM</A></H4>


<PRE>
Meta-data: none present

Data:
Byte number   0  1        N
            +--+--   -   --+
Hex values  | 0| free text |
            +--+--   -   --+
</PRE>

<P>
This allows arbitrary textual data to be added. It does not require a
identifier-value pairing or any nul termination.
