It is often desirable to completely remove a reading from a contig. When not
using the editor this is typically performed using the Disassemble Readings
function. See section <A HREF="gap5_52.html#SEC89">Disassemble Readings</A>.
When using the editor, the "Remove Reading" option on the editor commands
menu performs a similar task.

</P>
<P>
The command marks the reading underneath the editing cursor to be removed once
the editor is quitted. Until then, the reading number in the names section of
the display is shown with a dark grey background. The reading will also not be
used in the calculation of the consensus. Thus, if all readings at a
particular section of consensus are marked for removal the consensus sequence
will be shown as dashes. Selecting the "Removing Reading" command again with
the editing cursor on a reading already marked for removal will cancel the
removal request. The keyboard command of Control-H may also be used as a
shortcut to the "Removing Reading" command.

</P>
<P>
Once the editor has been quitted you will be asked whether you wish to
disassemble the marked readings. Answering "No" will simply quit the editor as
normal without removing any readings. Answering "Yes" will bring up the
usual "Disassemble Readings" dialogue. The options here allow removal of all
readings from this contig, or non-crucial only. A crucial reading is one that
will cause this contig to be broken into two or more segments. A choice is
also given as to whether the readings should be completely removed from this
database, or for each reading to be placed in its own contig. Pressing "OK"
now will remove the readings from the contig, breaking the contig if
necessary, and will quit the editor. Pressing "Cancel" will close the
"Disassemble Readings" dialogue without making any changes and will not quit
the editor.

</P>
<P>
At any time, quitting the editor and not disassembling the readings will leave
a List (see section <A HREF="gap5_69.html#SEC107">Lists</A>) named "disassemble" containing the
readings marked for removal. These may then be disassembled at a later stage
if necessary. However the list will only be available until the next editor is
quit (at which stage that editor will create its own, possibly blank,
disassemble list), so make a copy if necessary.
