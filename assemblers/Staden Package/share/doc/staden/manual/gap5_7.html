Gap5 commands such as Find Internal Joins
(see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>) and Find Repeats (see section <A HREF="gap5_44.html#SEC81">Find Repeats</A>)
automatically transform the Contig Selector (see section <A HREF="gap5_3.html#SEC8">Contig Selector</A>) to produce the Contig Comparator.  To
produce this transformation a copy of the Contig Selector is added at
right angles to the original window to create a two dimensional
rectangular surface on which to display the results of comparing or
checking contigs. Each of the functions plots its results as diagonal
lines of different colours.  If the plotted points are close to the main
diagonal they represent results from pairs of contigs that are in the
correct relative order.  Lines parallel to the main diagonal represent
contigs that are in the correct relative orientation to one another.
Those perpendicular to the main diagonal show results for which one
contig would need to be reversed before the pair could be joined.  The
manual contig dragging procedure can be used to change the relative
positions of contigs.  See section <A HREF="gap5_5.html#SEC10">Changing the Contig Order</A>. As the contigs are dragged the plotted results
will be automatically moved to their corresponding new positions.  This
means that if users drag the contigs to move their plotted results close
to the main diagonal they will be simultaneously putting their contigs
into the correct relative positions.

</P>

<P>
By use of popup menus the plotted results can be used to invoke a subset
of commands.  For example if the user clicks the right mouse button over
a result from Find Internal Joins a menu containing Invoke Join Editor
(see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">The Join Editor</A>) and Invoke
Contig Editors (see section <A HREF="gap5_11.html#SEC20">Editing in gap5</A>)
will pop up. If the user selects Invoke Join Editor the Join Editor will
be started with the two contigs aligned at the match position contained
in the result. If required one of the contigs will be complemented to
allow their alignment.

</P>
<P>
A typical display from the Contig Comparator is shown below. It
includes results for Find Internal Joins in black, Find Repeats in
red and Sequence Search in green. The currently highlighted item is
shown in pink with a summary at the bottom of the screen. The
orientation of this is from top-left to bottom-right indicating that
the match is in the same orientation within both contigs (we can see
some in the opposite orientation indicating that we need to reverse
complement either of the two contigs before attempting any joins,
although this will happen automatically).
The crosshairs show the positions for a pair of contigs. The vertical
line continues into the Contig Selector part of the display, and the
position represented by the horizontal line is also duplicated there.
