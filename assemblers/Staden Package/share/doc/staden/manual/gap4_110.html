This routine 
(which is available from the gap4 Experiments menu)
suggests which templates could be resequenced on a long gel
machine to fill in single stranded regions or extend contigs. The "Estimated
long reading length" tells the routine the expected length of reading that
will be produced by the sequencing machine. The routine finds all single
stranded regions, and where possible suggests solutions. Solutions will not be
suggested using readings from templates that have inconsistent read-pair
information.

The example output below shows a list of  problem  segments
followed by suggested templates.

<P>
        Some brief notes on the above output; looking at the suggested
  rerun of reading e05a1.s1.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Prob 1597..1736:        No +ve strand data.</CODE>
<DD>
A single stranded region has been identified in this contig at bases
1597 to 1736 inclusive.

<DT><CODE>"?D Long"</CODE>
<DD>
The optional two letters before the word "Long" are used to flag possibly
inconsistent templates (templates that are definitely inconsistent are
ignored). "?" means that no primer information is available
for the template that the reading is from. "D" means that the template size is not
within the expected minimum and maximum. In this case the observed size is
displayed (see below).

<DT><CODE>"Long       e05a1.s1  1198."</CODE>
<DD>
A possible solution; rerun reading e05a1.s1 as a long gel. The first
used base at the 5' end of this reading is at position 1198 in the
contig. Typically this roughly corresponds to the primer position for
this reading in the contig.

<DT><CODE>T_pos=329</CODE>
<DD>
The last used base at the 3' end of the reading is estimated to be the
329th base of the template.  Together with the template lengths this
gives us an estimate of how much template there is available for a long
gel or for walking.

<DT><CODE>T_size=1000..1500 (1250)</CODE>
<DD>
The estimated size for this template is 1250 bases.  Gap4 is supplied a
minimum and maximum size when a reading is assembled.  In this case the
minimum is 1000 bases, and the maximum 1500.  When 
forward and reverse reads assembled into the same contig
estimate the real length reasonably accurately. Otherwise (as can be
seen here), the estimated length is simply the average of the supplied
minimum and maximum lengths.

<DT><CODE>cov 156*</CODE>
<DD>
We would expect a long gel to cover our "hole" by 156 bases. This
estimate is based purely on the position of the start of the reading in
relation to the start of the hole, and the estimated length of a long
gel.  The asterisk here marks that this coverage is more than enough to
completely solve the problem by plugging the positive strand hole.
</DL>

<P>
For the problem "3974..4067" there is "No solution" listed.  This is due
to the fact that there are no suitable readings within the estimated
long gel reading length of this problem.
