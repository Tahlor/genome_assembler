Several editors can be used simultaneously, even on the same contig.
In the latter case, it is useful to understand the difference between
the data and the view of the data.

</P>
<P>
Each operating Contig Editor is a view of the data for
a particular contig. With two editors
viewing the same contig, making changes in either will modify the data
that both are viewing, hence the change will be visible in both
editors. Similarly, using Undo in either will undo the changes to both.

</P>
<P>
Interaction between Contig Editors and Join Editors is more
complicated and generally isn't advised. However such interactions
work consistently with the notion of views of contigs. For example,
suppose there are two Contig Editors open on two separate contigs, and in
addition to these a Join Editor displaying both contigs. Making the
join in the Join Editor will update the two stand-alone Contig Editors
so that they are each viewing the correct positions in the new contig,
even though they're both now viewing the same contig.
