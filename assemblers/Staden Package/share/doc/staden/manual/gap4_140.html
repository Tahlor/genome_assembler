Some lists are automatically updated or are generated on-the-fly as needed.
The lists named "contigs" and "readings" correspond to the currently selected
contigs in the contig selector window and the currently selected readings in
the template displays. Note that lists (with any names) can also be created
from selected items in the contig editor.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="gap4_63.html#SEC120">Set Output List</A>.
The "allcontigs" and "allreadings" lists are created as needed and always
contain an identifier for every contig and every reading identifier.

</P>
<P>
Because of the way the lists are implemented, as is outlined below,
there are some useful "tricks" that can be employed.
A list name consisting of a contig identifier surrounded by square
brackets ('[' and ']') will cause the creation of a list containing all of the
readings within that contig. For example, to use the Extract Readings
option (see section <A HREF="gap4_132.html#SEC203">Extract Readings</A>)
to extract all the readings from
contig 'xb54f8.s1', the list name given in the Extract Readings dialogue
would be '[xb54f8.s1]'.

</P>
<P>
A list name surrounded by curly brackets ('{' and '}') will cause the
creation of a list containing all of the readings in the contigs
named in the
specified list name. So '{contigs}' is equivalent to all the readings
in the
contigs contained in the 'contigs' list. Hence the 'allreadings' list is
identical to '{allcontigs}'.

</P>
<P>
These tricks can be used anywhere where a list name is required except for
editing and deletion of lists. As a final example,
to produce a file of filenames for the
currently selected contigs, save the list named '{contigs}' to a file.
