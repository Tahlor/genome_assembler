<P>
There are two main types of assembly - denovo and mapped - with the
latter not really being a true assembly at all.

</P>
<P>
Denovo assembly consists of an assembly of DNA fragments without
typically knowing any of the goal target sequence. Hence it compares
sequence fragments against each other in order to form contigs.
Mapped assembly makes uses of a known reference sequence and compares
all sequence fragments against the reference, which is a far simpler
and faster process than denovo assembly.

</P>
<P>
Gap5 however has neither denovo or mapped assembly built-in. Instead
it relies on externally running standard command-line tools. At
present this consists purely of using bwa for a mapped assembly, but
in future this will be expanded upon.

</P>
<P>
This means that the Assembly menu currently only contains a "Map
Reads" sub-menu, which is turn has multiple choices for bwa
usage. You will not be directly able to join contigs using these
facilities or to fill holes in the contig, although this is possible
by manually following some of the steps outlined below and using an
alternate step for generating the SAM file.
