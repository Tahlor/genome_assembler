<P>
The software handles batches of trace data from sequencing instruments. It 
performs
all processing except base calling (although it can employ third party
programs such as phred for this step). This includes file format
conversions, quality clipping, scanning for mutations and heterozygotes,
multiple sequence alignment, easy visual inspection of traces, production of
reports, and the accumulation and storage of readings and traces. The
software also handles the initialisation/configuration of standard
reference files and databases for any project. The two main programs are
pregap4 and gap4. Pregap4 (see section <A HREF="pregap4_3.html#SEC3">Pregap4 introduction</A>)
prepares data for gap4 by automatically using
a variety of smaller programs, including those used to search for mutations:
mutscan (see section <A HREF="pregap4_36.html#SEC42">Mutation Scanner</A>.
Gap4 (see section <A HREF="gap4_3.html#SEC3">Gap4 introduction</A>)
is used to store the aligned readings, to view the sequences and
traces, and to produce a report listing the observed mutations.

<P>
Any number of sequences can be processed in a  single run, and for each
individual  patient sample the  operation  is generally
performed in two steps. First, via pregap4, the traces are aligned and
compared to the reference traces and any possible mutations or heterozygous
bases marked.  Secondly,  the data  is transfered into a gap4 database
from  where  users can   visually check   the differences between  the
reference and patient traces.

</P>
<P>
The program mutscan (see section <A HREF="pregap4_36.html#SEC42">Mutation Scanner</A>) can automatically compare patient and reference traces to
find point mutations and heterozygous bases.  Users can set parameters
which control the sensistivity of the algorithms (and hence which
determine the ratio of false negative and positive results). Mutscan
adds tags of type "mutation" or "heterozygous" to the patient
files. The tags contain the numerical scores achieved at the site of
the reported base changes, and they can be viewed via the gap4
editor(see section <A HREF="gap5_11.html#SEC20">Editing in gap4</A>).  Mutscan is
normally run via pregap4 (see section <A HREF="pregap4_3.html#SEC3">Pregap4 introduction</A>).

</P>
<P>
The description of the programs given below is presented in reverse order of
use i.e. gap4 then pregap4, but first we give further details about the use
of reference data.
