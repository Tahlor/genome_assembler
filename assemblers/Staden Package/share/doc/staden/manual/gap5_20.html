Annotations (or tags) can be placed at any position on readings or on
the consensus. They are usually used to record positions of primers
for walking, or to mark sites, such as repeats or compressions, that
have caused problems during sequencing.  Each annotation has a type
such as "primer", a position, a length, a strand (forward, reverse
or both) and an optional comment. Each type and strand has an
associated colour that will be shown on the display. For information
on searching for annotations see section <A HREF="gap5_21.html#SEC35">Search by Tag Type</A>, and section <A HREF="gap5_21.html#SEC34">Search by Annotation Comments</A>.

<P>
<I>FIXME: not all of the tag editor features are supported yet;
specifically the Move/Copy functionality is currently missing.</I>

</P>
<P>
To create an annotation, make a selection and then select "Create Tag"
from the contig editor commands menu at the top of the editor or by
pressing the right mouse button.  @xref{Editor-Commands,Editor-Commands,The Commands Menu}. This will bring up a further window; the "tag editor" (shown
above). The "Type:" button at the top of the editor invokes a
selectable list from which tag types can be chosen.  See below.

</P>

<p>
<img src="contig_editor.tagsel.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
Use this to select the desired type of annotation.  

</P>
<P>
Next the strand of the annotation can be selected. This will be
displayed as one of "&#60;----&#62;", "&#60;----", "----&#62;" and "?----?"
indicating both strands, top strand only, bottom strand only, and
stranded but unknown strand respectively. These mirror the GFF strand
definitions.  The comment (the box beneath the buttons) can be edited
using the usual combination of keyboard input and arrow keys. The
"Save" button will exit the tag editor and create the annotation. To
abandon editing without creating the annotation use the "Cancel"
button.

</P>
<P>
To edit an existing annotation, position the editing cursor
within a annotation and select "Edit Tag" from the commands menu. This
will be a cascading menu, typically showing one tag. If multiple tags
coincide at the same sequence position you will be able to chose which
tag to edit. Once again the tag editor will be invoked and operates as
before. The <B>F11</B> key is also a shortcut for editing the top-most
tag underneath the editor cursor.
When editing, the "Save" will save the edited changes and "Cancel"
will abandon changes.

</P>
<P>
Removing a annotation involves positioning the editing cursor within
an annotation and selecting "Delete Tag" from the commands menu. As with
"Edit Tag" this is a cascading menu to allow you to chose which tag at a
specific point to delete. The <B>F12</B> key is a shortcut to remove the
top-most tag underneath the editor cursor.

</P>
<P>
As usual, "undo" can be used to undo any of these annotation creations,
edits and removals.

</P>
<P>
Some tags may contain graphical controls instead of the usual text
panel. These are encoded with the master gap4/5 tag database
(<I>GTAGDB</I>) by specifying the default tag text to be a piece of
"ACD" code. A full description of the (modified for gap4/5) ACD syntax
is not available currently, but it is strongly modelled on the the
EMBOSS ACD syntax which has documentation at
<a href="http://www.emboss.org/Acd/index.html">
http://www.emboss.org/Acd/index.html

</P>
</a>

<P>
It is possible to add your own tag types by modifying either the
system <I>GTAGDB</I> file or creating your own <I>GTAGDB</I> file in your
home directory (for all your databases) or the current directory (for
just those in that directory).

</P>
<P>
For rapid editing and deleting the F11 and F12 keys may be used. These
edit and delete the top-most tag underneath the editing cursor. If you
wish to edit or delete the tag underneath the mouse cursor instead (and
hence save a mouse click) use Shift F11 and Shift F12 for edit and delete.

</P>
<P>
The Control-Q key sequence may be used to toggle the displaying of tags.
Pressing it once will prevent all tags from being displayed in the editor.
This is sometimes useful to see any colouring information underneath the tag.
Pressing Control-Q once more will redisplay them.

<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC32">Annotation Macros</A></H3>

<p>
<img src="contig_editor.tagmacro.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
For rapid annotating a series of 10 macros may be programmed. Press
Shift and a function key between F1 and F10 to bring up the macro
editor. This look much like the normal tag editor except that <B>Save</B>
is replaced with <B>Save Macro</B> and saving does not actually create a
tag on the sequence. To use the macro, highlight the bases you wish and
press the function key corresponding to that macro - F1 to F10. For a
single base pair tag you do not need to underline a region as the tag
will automatically cover the base underneath the editing cursor. To
remember these permanently use the "Save Tag Macros" option in the
"Settings" menu.

</P>
<P>
If you have an existing tag you wish to rapidly duplicate to many
places, use Control plus a function key to copy the tag underneath the
editing cursor to that numbered tag macro. This is simply a short cut
for Shift and the function key, but without needing to manually
replicate the tag type and textual comment.

</P>
<P>
You may find that some function keys are already programmed to do other
things (such as raise or lower windows), depending on the windowing
environment in use. If this is the case either modify the configuration
of your windowing system or simply use another macro key.

</P>

<PRE>
 Shift   F1-F10           Create a tag macro via a dialogue window
 Control F1-F10           Create a tag macro from tag at editor cursor
 F1-F10                   Apply a tag macro (create a real tag)
