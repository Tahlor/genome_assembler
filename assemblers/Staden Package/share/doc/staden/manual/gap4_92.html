The program has several methods for assembly and it may not be obvious
which is most appropriate for a given problem. The following notes may
help. They also contain information on methods for checking the
correctness of an assembly.

</P>
<P>
If you have access to an
external program that can generate the order and approximate positions
of readings then Directed Assembly can be used. The same is true if the
experimental method used generates an ordered set of readings
(see section <A HREF="gap4_90.html#SEC159">Directed Assembly</A>).

</P>
<P>
If you have access to a external global assembly program that can
produce an assembly and write out correct experiment files then Directed
Assembly can still be used by specifying a "tolerance" of -1 (in the
experiment file AP lines).

</P>
<P>
For routine shotgun assembly of whole data-sets or incremental data-sets
Normal Shotgun Assembly can be used. Through the idea of "Masked
assembly" this option also can also restrict the assembly to particular
regions of the consensus
(see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Normal shotgun assembly</A>).

</P>
<P>
Note that 
Normal shotgun assembly (see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Normal Shotgun Assembly</A>),
Assemble independently (see section <A HREF="gap4_85.html#SEC154">Assembly Independently</A>),
Assembly into single stranded regions (see section <A HREF="gap4_87.html#SEC156">Assembly Single</A>),
Screen only (see section <A HREF="gap4_91.html#SEC160">Screen Only</A>),
Put all readings in separate contigs (see section <A HREF="gap4_89.html#SEC158">Assembly new</A>),
may require the parameter maxseq to be set beforehand
(see section <A HREF="gap4_172.html#SEC260">Set Maxseq</A>). This parameter defines the maximum
length of consensus that can be created. If you find that the assembly process
is only entering the first few hundred of a batch of readings, try increasing maxseq.

</P>
<P>
If you have a batch of readings that are known to overlap one another,
but which, due to repeats, may also match other places in the consensus,
then it can be helpful to use Assemble Independently. This will ensure
that the batch of readings are compared only to one another, and hence
will not be assembled into the wrong places
(see section <A HREF="gap4_86.html#SEC155">Assemble independently</A>).

</P>
<P>
Almost all readings are assembled automatically in their first pass
through the assembly routine. Those that are not can be dealt with in
two ways. Either they can be put through assembly again with less
stringent parameters, or entered using the "Put all readings in new
contigs" routine and then joined to the contig they overlap using Find
Internal Joins See section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>..
If it is found that readings are not being
assembled in their first pass through the assembler, then it is likely
that the contigs require some editing to improve the consensus. Also it
may be that poor quality data is being used, possibly by users
over-interpreting films or traces. In the long term it can be more
efficient to stop reading early and save time on editing. For those
using fluorescent sequencing machines the unused data can be
incorporated after assembly using the Contig Editor and Double Strand.

</P>
<P>
An independent and important check on assembly is obtained by
sequencing both ends of templates. Providing the correct information is
given in the experiment files gap can check the positions and
orientations of readings from the same
template (see section <A HREF="gap5_45.html#SEC82">Find read pairs</A>).
Any inconsistencies are
shown both textually and graphically. In addition this information can
be used to find possible joins between contigs.
