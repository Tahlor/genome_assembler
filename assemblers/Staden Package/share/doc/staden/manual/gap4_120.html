<H3><A NAME="SEC191" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC191">Consensus Calculation Using Weighted Base Frequencies</A></H3>

<P>
This method can be used when simple, unquantified, base call quality
values are available. Instead of simply counting base type frequencies
it sums the quality values.
Hence a column of 4 bases A,
A, A and T with confidence values 10, 10, 10 and 50 would give combined totals
of 30/80 for A and 50/80 for T (compared to 3/4 for A and 1/4 for 
T when using frequencies). As
with the unweighted frequency method this sets the confidence value of the
consensus base to be the the fraction of the chosen base type weights over the
total weights (62.5 in the above example).

</P>
<P>
The quality cutoff parameter controls which bases are used in the calculation.
Only bases with quality values greater than or equal to the quality cutoff are
used, otherwise they are completely ignored and have no effect on either the
base type chosen for the consensus or the consensus confidence value. In the
above example setting the quality cutoff to 20 would give a T with
confidence 100 (100 * 50/50).

</P>
<P>
In the event that more than one base type is calculated to have the same
weight, and this
exceeds the consensus cutoff, the bases are assigned in descending order of
precedence: A, C, G and T.
