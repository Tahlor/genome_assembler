The original trace data from which the readings where derived can be
displayed by double clicking (two quick clicks) with the left or
middle mouse button on the area of interest. Control-t has the same
effect.  The trace will be displayed centred around the base clicked
upon and the name of the reading in the contig editor will be
highlighted.  Double clicking on the consensus displays traces for all
the readings covering that position.

</P>
<P>
Moving the mouse pointer over a trace base causes the display of an
information line at the bottom of the window. This gives the base
type, its position in the sequence, and its confidence value.

</P>
<P>
There are two forms of trace display which are selected using the "Compact"
button at the top of the Trace display. The compact form differs by not
showing the Info, Diff, Comp. and Cancel buttons at the left of each trace.

</P>
<P>
Note that Gap5 does not store the trace files in the project database:
it stores only their names and reads them when required. By default it
will attempt to look for them in the current working directory (likely
the same directory as the gap database). However this can be adjusted
to look in other directories or via URLs using "Trace file location"
in the main Gap5 configure menu
(see section <A HREF="gap4_177.html#SEC265">Trace File Location</A>).

This figure is an example of the Trace Display showing three capillary
traces and an Illumina trace.  On the top line, the Lock checkbutton
keeps the trace data in sync with the editor cursor position. The
layout is controlled by the Columns and Rows selectors at the top of
the window; 2 column by up to 3 rows in the above screenshot. Show
confidence draws coloured bars and a numerical value representing the
quality of each individual base-call. 

</P>
<P>
The main trace panels each have the sequence name displayed in the top
left corner. Below this are X and Y zoom controls on the left and the
actual trace data on the right. The style of this will depend on the
type of trace. Sanger chromatograms take multiple samples per base and
are subsequently analysed (base-called) to identify the peaks and the
number/type of bases represented by that peak. These are drawn using
smooth lines, examples of which can be seen in the top row of the
image above. Illumina GA instruments are "clocked" in that each and
every measurement corresponds to one base. These are drawn using a
stick plot, as seen in the bottom row of the screen-shot. Note that it
is quite likely you will not have the processed trace data available
for Illumina GA sequences due to size constraints, so the above is
simply an example of what <I>could</I> be viewed rather than a typical
example.

</P>
<P>
454 instruments use pyro-sequencing and so produce a variable number
of bases per measurement, with each measurement being clocked to a
specific cycle (flow) on the sequencing instrument. Hence 454 data is
also drawn using a stick plot, although with potentially multiple
bases per measurement. An example is visible below.

The horizontal rulers in this plot correspond to normalised peak
intensities for 1.0, 2.0 and so on to indicate 1, 2, 3... bases per
flow. Clearly visible are flows of approximate height 1 (C T A G T on
the left), 2 (the following AA) and 0 (the G between the left most C
and T). Above these the confidence bars are visible.

Right clicking on a trace will bring up a popup menu containing the
following options.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><I>Information</I>
<DD>
Displays some basic textual information about the trace. The
information available will vary by trace type, but it may include
details such as the length, instrument and run-date.

<DT><I>Save</I>
<DD>
Saves the trace in ZTR format to a local file on disk. This can be
useful for when you are using a remote service for fetching traces or
extracting them from an archive such as .sff or .srf file.

<DT><I>Complement</I>
<DD>
Reverse complements the trace display. This does not modify data in
any way, but simply adjusts how it is drawn.

<DT><I>Quit</I>
<DD>
Removes this trace from the trace window. If it is the last displayed
trace then the window will be removed too.
