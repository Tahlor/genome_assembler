It is possible to highlight an area of a reading or the
consensus sequence in preparation for performing some further action
upon it. Such examples of actions are: creating annotations and
pasting into a new window. We call these highlighted areas
"selections". They are displayed as an underlined region.

</P>
<P>
The simplest way to make a selection is using the left mouse
button. Pressing the mouse button marks the base beneath the cursor 
as the start of the selection. Then, without releasing the button,
moving the mouse cursor adjusts the end of the selection. Finally
releasing the button will allow normal use of the mouse again. If
while marking a selection we reach the edge of the window then the
editor will automatically start scrolling for us.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes we may wish to make a particularly long selection, or just
extend an existing selection after we've already released the mouse
button. This can be done by using shift left mouse button to adjust
the end of the selection. Hence we can mark the start of the selection
using the left button, scroll along the contig to the desired
position, and set the end using the shift left button.

</P>
<P>
The selection is stored in the "clipboard". This allows for
the usual "cut and paste" operations between applications, although
the contig editor only supports this in one direction (as it is not
possible to "paste" into the window). The mechanism employed for this
follows the usual X Windows standard of using the middle mouse button.

</P>
<P>
A quick summary of the mouse selection commands follows.
