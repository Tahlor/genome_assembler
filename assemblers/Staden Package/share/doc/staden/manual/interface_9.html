The main screen has three portions; the menubar, the output window and the
error window. Of these, the output and error windows are identical except for
the data that appears within them. Here we describe the general operation of
the output window only, although the details apply to the error window too.

</P>

<P>
The output window consists of a text window with a set of labels and buttons
above it. At the top left is the window name followed by a colon. After
the colon the name of the current output file will be shown in blue italic
letters. All new output appearing in this window will also be sent to this
file. Initially no output file is specified and this label is blank (as can be
seen in the error window). Using the "Redirect" menu located at the top right
of the window a new file can be opened, or an existing one closed (in which
case output is no longer sent to the specified file). The output and error
windows may both have redirection files.

</P>
<P>
The "Search" button invokes a dialogue box requesting a string to search
and whether to search forwards or backwards from the current position of
the cursor. The search is case insensitive. Hitting the the OK button finds 
the next match.The bell is sounded if no more matches can be found. 

</P>
<P>
The "Scroll on output" check button toggles whether the window should
automatically scroll when new output appears to ensure that it is
visible. The default (as seen in the illustration) state is to
scroll. The "Clear" button removes all output from the window.

</P>
<P>
Each command, when run, adds a title to the output window. This
contains the current time together with the command name. Output for
this command then appears beneath the header. In the illustration the
output from three commands is visible. Of these the "edit contig"
command produces no output, but still has a header.

</P>
<P>
Pressing the right button with the cursor above a piece of output
(either in its header or the text beneath it) will pop up a menu of
operations. This operation is not valid for the error window. The
commands are:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>Show input parameters</CODE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Inserts the input parameters of the command, if any, beneath the 
command header
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<CODE>Remove</CODE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Deletes this text from the output window
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<CODE>Output to disk</CODE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Sends this text to a specified file
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<CODE>Output to list</CODE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Sends this text to a specified list
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The output operations allow the user to specify whether the header, input 
parameters or text for the command, in any combination, are sent to the
output.

</P>

<P>
The text in the error window has a different format to the output
window. Instead of large portions of text separated by headers, each
item in the error window consists of a single line containing the
date, the name of the function producing the error, and a brief
description of the error. Many error messages will be displayed in
their own dialogue boxes (eg not having write access to a file) and
hence will not appear in the error window.  Each time an error message
is added the bell is rung.
