<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC7">Introduction to the Contig Selector</A></H3>

<P>
The gap4 Contig Selector is used to display, select and reorder contigs.
In the Contig Selector all contigs
are shown as colinear horizontal lines separated by short vertical
lines. The length of the horizontal
lines is proportional to the length of the contigs and their left to
right order represents the current
ordering of the contigs. Users can change the contig order by
dragging the lines representing the contigs. This is done by clicking
and holding the middle mouse button, or Alt left mouse button, 
on a line and then moving the mouse cursor.
The Contig Selector can also be used to select
contigs for processing. For example, clicking with the right mouse
button on the line representing a
contig will invoke a menu containing the
commands which can be performed on that
contig. 
There are several alternative ways of specifying which contig an
operation should be performed on. Contigs are identified by the name or
number of any reading they contain. When a dialogue is requesting a
contig name, using the left mouse button to click on the contig in the
Contig Selector will
transfer its name to the dialogue box. Other methods are available
(see section <A HREF="gap5_4.html#SEC9">Selecting Contigs</A>).

</P>
<P>
As the mouse is moved over a contig, it is highlighted and the contig
name (left
most reading name) and length are displayed in the Information Line. 
The number in brackets is the contig number (actually the number of its
leftmost reading).
Tags or annotations
(see section <A HREF="gap4_18.html#SEC25">Annotating and masking readings and contigs</A>)
can also be displayed in the
Contig Selector window.

The figure shows a typical display from  the Contig Selector. At the top
are the File, View and Results menus. Below that are buttons for
zooming and  for displaying the crosshair. The  four  boxes to the
right are used to display the X and  Y coordinates of the crosshair. The
rightmost two   display the Y  coordinates  when the contig  selector is
transformed  into    the   Contig   Comparator.
The  two leftmost   boxes display the  X  coordinates: the
leftmost is the position in the contig and the  other is the position in
the overall consensus. The  crosshair is the  vertical line spanning the
panel below. Tags are shown as coloured rectangles above and below the
lines
(see section <A HREF="gap5_3.html#SEC8">Contig Selector</A>).
