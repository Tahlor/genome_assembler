<P>
From the "settings" menu of the editor
the trace display can be set to "Auto-Diff traces". Once this is
activated, whenever the user double clicks on a base in the editor
sequence display, not only is the reading's trace displayed, but also
its designated reference trace plus the difference between them. If its
complementary reading is available, its trace and reference trace and
their differences are also displayed.

</P>
<P>
The preferred way of assigning reference traces to readings is by use of
"naming conventions"; that is to have a simple set of rules which
control the names given to the trace files. It can be seen in the
figures showing the editor that forward and reverse readings from the
same patient have names with a common root but which end either F or
R. This both ties the two together (so the software knows which is the
corresponding 
complementary trace when the user double clicks on a reading) and also
enables the association of readings and their reference traces. Once a
convention has been adopted the rules can be defined for pregap4 by
loading them via the "Load Naming Scheme" option in its File menu
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_47.html#SEC53">Pregap4 Naming Schemes</A>). For
any batch of readings the reference traces are defined within pregap4's
"Reference Traces" module.

</P>
<P>
Within the Contig Editor reference traces can be set by right clicking
on their names in the editor. When this is done a menu will popup. This
allows the user to select whether the trace is to be used as a 
positive or negative control.
