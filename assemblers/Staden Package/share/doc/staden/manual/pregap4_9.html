<P>
When pregap4 is started the user first needs to
select the files to process. This is done using the "Files to Process"
command (from the File menu).

</P>
<P>
The "Configure Modules" tab allows for the currently available modules to
be enabled or disabled, and the module parameters edited accordingly.

</P>
<P>
Once all modules have been configured (so that none have <CODE>edit</CODE> listed
next to their name) pregap4 is ready to begin processing. This is
started by pressing
"Run" or by selecting "Run" from the File menu. 

</P>
<P>
When pregap4 has a setup that would be useful in the future
"Save All Parameters (in all modules)" from the Modules menu can be
used, and pregap4 will store all the module parameters to a
configuration file ready for subsequent runs.

</P>

<P>
When processing has 
finished pregap4 will produce a report containing information
from each module and the final list of passed and failed sequences.

</P>
<P>
If for any reason pregap4 fails a particular step in the processing, users
are strongly recommended to correct whatever has caused the module to fail,
clean up any files it has created, and then repeat the whole process. That
is, until users have a good understanding of what happens at each stage of
processing, it is better to repeat all the steps with the original list of
files, than to try to guess which step to continue from.

</P>
