<P>
Editing can take up a significant portion of the time taken to finish
a sequencing project. Gap5 has a selection of searches
(see section <A HREF="gap5_21.html#SEC33">Searching</A>) designed to speed
up this process.  The problems that require most attention are
conflicts between good bases. Where base confidence values are present
it should be unnecessary to edit all conflicting bases as, generally,
this will amount to adjusting poor quality data to agree with good
quality data in which case the consensus sequence should be correct
anyway.

</P>
<P>
Pads in the consensus should not be considered a problem requiring
edits because it is possible to output the consensus sequence (from
the main Gap5 File menu) with pads stripped out. Obviously poorly
defined pads (a mixture of several alignment padding characters and
real bases) require checking in the same manner as other poorly
defined consensus bases.

</P>
<P>
To change a base simply overtype with a new base call, one of a,c,g or
t in lowercase. Alternatively a base can be changed to an alignment
padding character by pressing "*". These new bases and pads
automatically get given a quality value of 100, but see below for how
to adjust this. The consensus cannot be edited in this manner.

</P>
<P>
To insert a gap into sequence press "i" or the Insert key. At present
only alignment pads can be inserted, not bases, although the pads can
subsequently be edited to turn them into bases. The "i" and Insert
keys also permits insertions of gaps into the consensus, which it
achieves by inserting into every sequence aligned at that position.

</P>
<P>
Bases may be deleted by pressing the Delete or Backspace key. This
deletes the base immediately to the left of the current editing
cursor. Note that if Delete or Backspace is pressed with the editing
cursor on the consensus this removes an entire column of
data. Deleting anything other than alignment padding characters
(either in sequences or the consensus) is a dangerous operation
needing careful thought. To prevent accidental removal of data
therefore, to delete anything other than "*" you must press Control
in conjunction with Delete or Backspace.
