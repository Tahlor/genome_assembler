This method was first described by
McLachlan <CITE>Mclachlan,A.D. Tests for comparing related amino acid sequences
J. Mol. Biol. 61, 409-424 (1971)</CITE>. 
It involves calculating a score for each position in the plot
by summing points found when looking forwards and
backwards along a diagonal line of a given length (window length). The
algorithm does not simply look for identity but uses a score matrix that
contains scores for every possible pair of character types. At each point
that the score is above a minimum score, a match is saved. The matches
are plotted as a single point in the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot, corresponding to the centre of the
matching span (
see section <A HREF="spin_45.html#SEC66">SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot</A>) (Although see "Rescan
matches, below).

The dialogue box (shown above) requests the horizontal and vertical sequences
and their ranges (
see section <A HREF="spin_49.html#SEC97">Selecting a sequence</A>), 
the window span length and the minimum score. 
Only results above this minimum score are plotted. The default
value for the minimum score is one that would produce
approximately 500 matches between two random sequences of the same
composition as the two under investigation
(
see section <A HREF="spin_40.html#SEC51">Probabilities and expected numbers of matches</A>). 
This value of 500 can be changed using the "Configure default number
of matches" option of the "Options" menu on the main menubar
(
see section <A HREF="spin_40.html#SEC53">Changing the default number of matches</A>). The upper and lower limits of the minimum score are similarly
determined except that the expected number of matches for the upper limit is
0 and for the lower limit is "maximum number of matches". The "maximum number of
matches" value can be altered if more matches are required to be plotted by 
using the
"Configure maximum number of matches" option of the "Options" menu
(
see section <A HREF="spin_40.html#SEC52">Changing the maximum number of matches</A>).

This command gives a brief description of the sequences used in the comparison,
the input parameters used and the number of matches found.

<DT><VAR>Tabulate Scores</VAR>
<DD>
This option lists scores, probabilities, and their expected and
observed numbers of matches.


<PRE>

score    9 probability 1.73e-04 expected          365 observed 1772
score   10 probability 1.17e-05 expected           25 observed 601
score   11 probability 3.60e-07 expected            1 observed 149

<DT><VAR>Rescan matches</VAR>
<DD>
It is also possible to plot a dot for each residue with a score above a 
minimum value within each matching span using the "Rescan matches" command.
This is only a temporary result and will be destroyed if the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot is
altered (see section <A HREF="spin_40.html#SEC50">Controlling and Managing Results</A>).

<DT><VAR>Configure</VAR>
<DD>
This option allows the line width and colour of the matches to be altered. 
See section <A HREF="interface_11.html#SEC13">Colour Selector</A>.
A colour browser is displayed from which the desired line width or colour can 
be configured. Pressing OK will update the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot.

<DT><VAR>Display sequences</VAR>
<DD>
Selecting this command invokes the SPIN Sequence Comparison Display 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_47.html#SEC71">Sequence Comparison Display</A>). 
Moving the cursor in the sequence display will move the cursors of the
same sequence in any SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot (
see section <A HREF="spin_46.html#SEC67">Cursors</A>).
To force the sequence display to show the nearest match,
use the "nearest match" button in the sequence display plot. To force
the sequences to maintain their current register activate the "Lock" button.

<DT><VAR>Hide</VAR>
<DD>
This option removes the points from the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot but retains the information
in memory.

<DT><VAR>Reveal</VAR>
<DD>
This option will redisplay previously hidden points in the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot.

<DT><VAR>Remove</VAR>
<DD>
This command removes all the information regarding this particular
invocation of Find similar spans and access to this data lost.
