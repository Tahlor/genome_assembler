The gap4 Contig Selector is used to display, select and reorder contigs.
It can be invoked from the gap4 View menu, but will automatically appear when
a database is opened.  In the Contig Selector all contigs are shown as
colinear horizontal lines separated by short vertical lines.  The length of
the horizontal lines is proportional to the length of the contigs and their
left to right order represents the current ordering of the contigs. This
Contig Order is stored in the gap database and users can change it by
dragging the lines representing the contigs in the display.  The Contig
Selector can also be used to select contigs for processing.

</P>
<P>
Tags
(see section <A HREF="gap4_18.html#SEC25">Annotating and masking readings and contigs</A>) can
also be displayed in the Contig Selector window.  As the mouse is moved over a
contig, it is highlighted and the contig name (left most reading name) and
length are displayed in the status line. The number in brackets is the contig
number.

The figure shows a typical display from the Contig Selector. At the top are
the File, View and Results menus.  Below that are buttons for zooming
and for displaying the crosshair. The four boxes to the right
are used to display
the X and Y coordinates of the crosshair. The rightmost two display the Y
coordinates when the contig selector is transformed into the contig comparator
(see section <A HREF="gap5_7.html#SEC12">Contig Comparator</A>).
The two leftmost boxes display the X coordinates: the
leftmost is the position in the contig and the other is the position
in the overall consensus.  The crosshair is the vertical line spanning the
panel below. 

</P>
<P>
This panel shows the lines that represent the contigs and the
currently active tags. Those tags shown above the contig lines are on readings
and those below are on the consensus.  Right clicking on a tag gives a
menu containing "information" (to see the tag contents) and "Edit
contig at tag" which invokes the contig editor centred on the
selected tag.

</P>
<P>
The information line is showing data for
the contig that is currently under the crosshair.
