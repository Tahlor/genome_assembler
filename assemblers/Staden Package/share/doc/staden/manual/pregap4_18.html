ATQA is not include as part of the Staden package. It is available from
its developers, Daniel H. Wagner, Associates, at

<DT><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<DD>
The ATQA program estimates confidence values for each called base in a
lane file. A confidence value corresponds to the probability that the
associated base call is incorrect by the formula


<PRE>
score = -10*log10(probability of error).
</PRE>

(This is the same log scale used by Phred.) In fact, the ATQA program
computes four confidence values for each called base. The first three
values correspond to the probabilities of substitution, insertion, and
deletion errors, respectively. The fourth value is a combined score
representing the probability that the called base is an error of any
sort. Currently, only the combined confidence value is used by Staden
package software.
<P>
Unlike Phred, the ATQA program does not produce base calls. Rather, it
assigns confidence values to each base call in a lane file based on
features of the trace data. The current version of the ATQA program is
tuned to base calls made by the ABI base caller and to trace data from
the ABI 377 sequencer.
<P>
Although ATQA can read ABI files, it will not create SCF files in such
circumstances. However pregap4 will always convert any non SCF trace files
into SCF format before running ATQA, so an explicit conversion is not
required.
