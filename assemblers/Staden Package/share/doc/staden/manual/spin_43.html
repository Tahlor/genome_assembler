Each sequence shown in the "Sequence manager" list can have its own
"Sequence display" window.
The Sequence display provides a way of viewing and scrolling along the
characters of the sequence. It can also show translations to protein and
the positions of restriction enzyme cutting sites. Movement along the
sequence is controlled by standard mouse and cursor commands and by the
use of a subsequence/string search routine. The cursor can also be controlled by
dragging the cursor in the programs' graphical displays.

<P>
When restriction enzyme cutting sites are shown in the Sequence display
window the number of rows of text to be displayed at any position along the
sequence varies with the density of the sites. This presents a tricky
problem about how to position the lines of text relative to the top and
bottom of the window. Should the height of the window grow and shrink
vertically as the user scrolls? Should the window maintain a fixed
height, in which case should the top or the bottom be clipped if the
number of lines of text exceeds the window height? We have programmed it
so that
the nucleotide sequence remains at a fixed height to provide a constant
reference and the user can select this height by use of a vertical
scroll bar and by growing or shrinking the window. The scroll bar will
allow vertical movement when the number of lines of text exceeds the
current window size.
