A list of Experiment File line types may be viewed and edited using this
option (see section <A HREF="formats_19.html#SEC41">Experiment file format record types</A>).
A table of the Experiment File line types is displayed along with
their current values. A brief description of the line type underneath the
mouse cursor is displayed in the Information Line
at the bottom of the window. The table consists of
three columns. The first is a label identifying the line being edited. The
second column is an option menu from which either <I>Value</I> or <I>Command</I> may
be selected. The third column is the current value or command.

Line type values will be used for every sequence. The Augment Experiment Files
module will add this line type to each Experiment File. This is suitable for
specifying information which is constant across an entire batch, such as
insert size (SI) or operator (OP). The Line type commands are executed each
time the Augment Experiment Files module adds that line to the Experiment
File. Hence the commands are used for information which may change from
sequence to sequence. This table should be used for editing line type values,
but we do not recommend that you use it for editing commands (although it is
useful to know which commands have been set).

</P>
<P>
In the above example the PR, SP and ST commands were generated using the
Simple Text Database interface, whilst the SC and SF values come from the
Sequencing Vector Clip module parameters and the SI value was typed in by
hand using this table.

</P>
<P>
The "OK (in memory)" and "OK (and save)" buttons will accept the currently
displayed values and commands. The "OK (in memory)" button will use these
settings for the current pregap4 runs. The "OK (and save)" button will use
them for the current session and all subsequent pregap4 sessions as it saves
the information to the pregap4 configuration file.
