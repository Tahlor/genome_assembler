Inconsistencies in the selection of options, such as selecting -I and
-i, should also cause the usage message (shown below) to appear, and 
the program to terminate.

Usage: screen_seq [options and paramters] 
Where options and parameters are:
    [-l minimum match (25)]           [-m Max vector length (100000)]
    [-i readings to screen fofn]      [-I reading to screen]
    [-s seqs to screen against fofn]  [-S seq to screen against]
    [-t test only]
    [-p passed fofn]                  [-f failed fofn]
