The template display is a graphical overview of a single contig. It
allows us to see how much data we have, how long the fragments are and
how they relate to each other (whether they are forming valid pairs).

</P>

<p>
<img src="gap5_template_by_size.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
The window consists of one or more tracks, by default showing the
reading template layout at the top and a sequence / read-pair coverage
plot at the bottom. The Tracks menu allows us to turn these on and off.

</P>
<P>
Below the main menu bar is a series of buttons that bring up new
dialogues for controlling how the data is to be display and what is to
be displayed.

</P>
<P>
Then come a graphic plot per track. A cross-hair automatically tracks
the cursor, indicating the X and Y coordinates (in appropriate units)
in the status line at the bottom of the window. The track displays can
be moved by either using the horizontal and vertical scrollbars at the
bottom and right hand edges of the window, or by clicking and dragging
the contents of the window. While dragging the display will not update
to show newly visible regions of a contig until the left mouse button
is released. 

</P>
<P>
Finally the bottom contains a scrollbar and ruler for positioning and
a series of controls. The X scale simply controls how many
base-pairs of the contig are covered by he window. The X scale number
is arbitrary, but is interpreted in an exponential manner so it is
easy to rapidly zoom in or zoom out.  All other controls in the bottom
panel do not affect the reading coverage track, so they are covered in
the template track section below.

</P>

<!-- NODE:Template-Filter -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC16">Filtering data</A></H2>

<P>
By default all templates are used for drawing the tracks, but there
are times when we may wish to focus on specific problem data or to
exclude it from our graphics.

</P>

<p>
<img src="gap5_template_filter.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
The Filter button at the top of the Template Display brings up the
dialogue shown above. Making changes to this dialogue either have an
instant impact on the display (when "Auto update" is enabled) or
instead only when we hit Apply or OK to dismiss the dialogue.

</P>
<P>
The Pairs: section allows us to select either reads on all templates,
reads that are the sole read for that template, or reads that are
paired on a template.  Note that the definition of a pair here is
strictly dependant on how many reads for a template are in the 
gap5 database rather than the library preparation strategy. So a
paired-end template for which only one read is in the gap5 database
(perhaps due to failure to map) is classified as "single".

</P>
<P>
The Consistency section can be used to select all, consistent only or
inconsistent only data. This requires read-paired data (single reads
cannot be inconsistent as so are considered as consistent). The
interpretation of inconsistent currently is that the two reads of a
pair do not point towards one another, but in future releases this is
planned to check the correct orientation for that library type as for
some constructions it is normal to have reads pointing in the same
orientation.

</P>
<P>
The Spanning section governs whether to display read pairs with one
read in this contig and the other read in another contig. Handling
templates with more than two reads is still on-going work, but when
finished a spanning read-pair will be one with any read not in this
contig.

</P>
<P>
Underneath these are two sliders applied in addition to the above
filters. They allow removal of any read or read-pair (depending on the
type of data being plotted) with a mapping quality outside the
selected range.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Template-Template -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC17">Template plot</A></H2>

<P>
This is the main body of the template display window. The default plot
will be showing read-pairs, mainly coloured by mapping quality with
the insert size governing the Y coordinate. Larger inserts are at the
bottom of the track while shorter ones are at the top.

</P>
<P>
The colours used are as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>blue</STRONG>
<DD>
This is a template with only one reading present. It could be either a
pair with one end not in this assembly, or a true single-ended
sequencing experiment. The horizontal size of the line is now the
length of the individual sequence rather than the computed length of
the insert.

<DT><STRONG>orange</STRONG>
<DD>
This is a template with one reading present in another contig. The
size of the line is derived from the size of the data in this contig
(typically a single reading).

<DT><STRONG>red</STRONG>
<DD>
This template is considered as inconsistent in some manner, typically
due to the relative position and orientation of the forward and
reverse sequences being incorrect.

<DT><STRONG>grey (variety of)</STRONG>
<DD>
Any consistent read-pair is coloured by the mapping quality, by
default using the average of the individual sequence mapping
qualities. Lighter shades represent higher mapping qualities.
</DL>

<P>
The row of scale bars at the bottom of the window control how data is
to be plotted. They are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>X Scale</STRONG>
<DD>
Controls how many base-pairs in the contig to plot. Higher values
indicate more base pairs, but with an exponentially growing scale.

<DT><STRONG>Y Magnification</STRONG>
<DD>
Governs the amount of vertical space consumed by the template track.
This has no impact on the depth track.

<DT><STRONG>Y Offset</STRONG>
<DD>
Adds a small shift to the Y position of data prior to plotting. This
is of little use unless Separate Strands has also been selected, where
upon this allows the two halves of the plot to be brought closer
together. (Effectively meaning the a plot can go from -1000 to -100 and
+100 to +1000 instead of -1000 to +1000 with a blank area in the
middle if our sequences are a minimum of 100 bases long.)

<DT><STRONG>Stacking Y Size</STRONG>
<DD>
Only of use in Stacking Y-Position mode. This vertically groups
together data of similar length, allowing a basic approach of
separating short-read and long-read technologies. The Y layout is
performed in steps of "Stacking Y Size". To pack reads tightly
together regardless of length,  set this to the maximum value possible.

<DT><STRONG>Y Spread</STRONG>
<DD>
This adds a small perturbation to the computed Y coordinates of lines
in the template track. When the Y coordinate is derived based on the
insert size of the read-pair it is not always clear whether a line
represents a single item or many items stacked perfectly on top of one
another. The Y spread control compensates for this.

</DL>

<!-- NODE:Template-Y-Type -->


<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC18">Controlling The Y Layout.</A></H3>

<P>
The layout and type of data in the template track can be controlled
using the Template button at the top of the main template display
window.

</P>

<p>
<img src="gap5_template_template.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
The Y Position section controls how the Y coordinates are computed
when plotting data (with X being tied to the position in the assembly
or reference). It can be one of three settings.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Template size</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<img src="gap5_template_by_size.png" alt="[picture]">

The default mode. The size of an object is defined to be the number of
bases it spans. This is normally the size of a read-pair, or if the
pair spans contigs or if only readings are shown it is the size of a
single reading instead. Larger objects are at the bottom of the
window. This Y method very clearly reveals indels in a mapped
assembly. It sometimes also sometimes reveals misassemblies.

Given that items of identical size will stack on top of one another,
of particular use to this display mode is the Y Spread control in the
main window.

<DT><STRONG>Stacking</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<img src="gap5_template_by_stacking.png" alt="[picture]">

A more traditional view - each and every item is allocated its own
non-overlapping Y coordinate (although low Y magnifications may imply
these are drawn at the same Y pixel).

It is still possible to partially group items by their insert size
using the "Stacking Y Size" control in the main window.

<DT><STRONG>Mapping Quality</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<img src="gap5_template_by_mapping.png" alt="[picture]">

Finally we can display data collated by the mapping score. This is
typically only available for mapped assemblies. This plot sometimes
helps to reveal regions where all the data present is of poor mapping
quality, indicating a likely repeat.
</DL>

<P>
Adjacent to the Y Position frame is the Colour frame. This controls
the colour of the lines drawn in the template display rather than
their location.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Combined mapping quality</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Minimum mapping quality</STRONG>
<DD>
<DT><STRONG>Maximum mapping quality</STRONG>
<DD>
For templates with multiple reads visible, we have a variety of
mapping qualities. Often these individual sequence mapping qualities
will differ, but we wish to draw a single line for the template with a
single colour. These three methods control whether we take the
average, minimum or maximum values from the individual sequences on
this template.

<DT><STRONG>Reads</STRONG>
<DD>
The line typically represents the entire span of the insert, but we
may not have sequence data for all of the template. This colour mode
will also draw the portions of the template that we have known
sequence for, in green for forward strand sequences and magenta for
reverse strand sequences. Any remaining portion of template between
the reads is drawn using the combined mapping quality.
</DL>

<P>
At the bottom of this dialogue is a row of check buttons.

</P>
<P>
"&#62;&#62;Acc" enables accurate mode, but be warned this can be very
slow.  When the template display is drawn it fetches all data within
the visible portion plus a little bit ether side. From this reads from
the same template are paired up. However when a template spans a
substantially larger range than is shown we may only have fetched one
read for this template. We do know that such a template forms a pair,
but we do not know the exact location of the other end or even whether
it is in this contig. The assumption is that it is not, and the
template is drawn in orange. Enabling accurate mode will work out the
precise location of the other end and if it is present elsewhere
within this contig then the insert size will be correctly determined
and the plot adjusted accordingly.

</P>
<P>
The "Reads" checkbutton (not to be confused with the Reads colour
selector) disables all drawing of read-pairing and template lines,
instead drawing lines to represent the known DNA sequence instead.

</P>
<P>
"Y-log scale" controls whether we plot our Y values using log or
linear scales.

</P>
<P>
"Separate strands" attempts to classify all templates as coming from
the top or bottom strand of DNA (based on the orientation of the
sequences on that template, although sometimes these are
conflicting). It then splits the plot in two, forming an approximate
mirror image. This may be of use in some transcriptome sequencing
experiments.

</P>
<!-- NODE:Template-Depth -->


<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="gap5_toc.html#SEC19">Depth / Coverage Plot</A></H2>

<P>
The depth track shows coverage of both individual readings and
read-pairs, where a read-pair counts as +1 coverage over the entire
length it spans rather than just the portion directly sequenced.

</P>
<P>
The filter options for (in)consistent read pairs also apply here,
giving the option to only show depth of consistent pairs.
