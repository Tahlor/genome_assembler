<H2><A NAME="SEC138" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC138">Using Several Editors at Once</A></H2>
<P>

Several editors can be used simultaneously, even on the same contig.
In the latter
case, it is useful to understand the difference between the data and
the view of the data.

</P>
<P>
Each operating Contig Editor is a view of the data for
a particular contig. With two editors
viewing the same contig, making changes in either will effect the data
that both are viewing, hence the change will be visible in both
editors. Similarly, using Undo in either will undo the changes to both.

</P>
<P>
When quitting and saving
changes, other editors for the same contig will act as if a "Save
Contig" request has been made by using the "Commands" menu (ie changes
are written to disk and the undo information will be reset). Answering
"no" to the "Save changes" query,
simply shuts down the editor without saving. If there is no other
editor for this contig then the changes will be lost, otherwise the
changes will be retained until the last editor for the contig is
exited.

</P>
<P>
Interaction between Contig Editors and Join Editors is more
complicated and generally isn't advised. However such interactions
work consistently with the notion of views of contigs. For example,
suppose there are two Contig Editors open on two separate contigs, and in
addition to these a Join Editor displaying both contigs. Making the
join in the Join Editor will update the two stand-alone Contig Editors
so that they are each 
viewing the correct positions in the new contig, even though
they're both now viewing the same contig.
