<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC14">Introduction to the Contig Joining Editor</A></H3>

<P>
Contigs are joined interactively using the Join Editor.
This is simply a pair
of contig editor displays stacked one above the other with a "differences"
line in between. The Contig Join Editor is usually invoked by clicking
on a Find Internal Joins, or Find Repeats result in the Contig
Comparator. In which case the two contigs will appear 
with the match found by these searches displayed.

</P>
<P>
The few differences between the Join Editor and the Contig Editor can be seen
in the figure below. Otherwise all the commands and operations are the
same as those for the Contig Editor.

<P>
In this figure the Cutoff or Hidden data is being displayed for the
right hand contig. One difference between the Contig Editor and the Join
Editor is the Lock button. When set (as it is in the
illustration) the two contigs scroll in register, otherwise they can be
scrolled independently.

</P>
<P>
The Align button aligns the overlapping consensus sequences
(see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">Editor joining</A>).
