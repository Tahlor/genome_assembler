The Reading and Template Plot shows templates and readings. The
following sections describe the display, its options, and the operations
which it can be used to perform.
It is invoked from the main gap4 View menu.

<P>
The Reading and Template Plot shows templates and readings.  Colour is used to
provide additional information.
The reading colour is used to convey the primer
information. The default colours are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>red</VAR>
<DD>
primer unknown
<DT><VAR>green</VAR>
<DD>
forwards primer
<DT><VAR>orange</VAR>
<DD>
reverse primer
<DT><VAR>dark_cyan</VAR>
<DD>
custom forward primer
<DT><VAR>orange-red</VAR>
<DD>
custom reverse primer
</DL>

<P>
Colour is used to distinguish the number and the location
of the readings derived from each template.
Templates with readings derived from only one end are drawn in blue. 
Those with readings from both ends
are pink when both ends are contained within the same contig.
Those with readings from both ends are green when
the readings are in different contigs and one of 
the contigs is not being plotted.

</P>
<P>
For each template gap4 stores an expected length, as a range between two
values. From an assembly it is often possible to work out the actual length of
a template based upon the positions within a contig of readings sequenced
using the forward and reverse primers. The forward and reverse readings on
a single template (called a read pair) are considered to be inconsistent if 
this observed distance is outside of
the range of acceptable sizes and then the template is drawn in black. 
Alternatively it may be possible that both forward and reverse readings are 
assembled on the same strand (in which case both arrows will point in the same
direction). This too is a problem and hence the templates are drawn in
black. 

</P>
<P>
If more than one contig is displayed then the distance between adjacent 
contigs is determined from any read pair information. If there are spanning 
templates between two adjacent contigs and the readings on that template are 
consistent, i.e. are in the correct orientation, the template is coloured yellow. 
Templates which span non-adjacent contigs in the display or contain 
inconsistent readings are coloured dark yellow.

</P>
<P>
A summary of the default template colours follows.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>blue</VAR>
<DD>
the template contains only readings from one end
<DT><VAR>pink</VAR>
<DD>
the template contains both forward and reverse readings in the same contig
<DT><VAR>green</VAR>
<DD>
the template contains both forward and reverse readings, but they are in
separate contigs, and one of the contigs is not being displayed.
<DT><VAR>black</VAR>
<DD>
the readings on the template are within the same contig but are in
contradictory orientations or are an unexpected distance apart
<DT><VAR>yellow</VAR>
<DD>
the readings on the template are within different contigs (both of which are being displayed) and are consistent
<DT><VAR>dark_yellow</VAR>
<DD>
the readings on the template are within different contigs (both of which are being displayed) and are inconsistent

If more than one contig is displayed, the contigs are positioned in the same
left to right order as the input contig list, (which need not necessarily be in
the same order as the contig selector).
Overlapping contigs are drawn as staggered lines. 
If the user selects the "Calculate contig positions" option from the menu
the horizontal distance between adjacent contigs is
determined from any available read pair information. 
Otherwise, or in the absence of any read pair
information, the second contig is positioned immediately following the first
contig, but will be drawn staggered in the vertical direction. If the 
readings on a template spanning two contigs are consistent, the distance 
between the contigs is determined using the template's mean length.
If there are several templates spanning a pair of contigs
an average distance is calculated and used as the final 
offset between the contigs. 
Templates which span non-adjacent contigs or contain inconsistent readings 
are not used in the calculation of the contig offsets. It is possible that 
data in the database is inconsistent to such an extent that, although spanning 
templates have consistent readings, the averaging can lead to a display which 
shows the templates to have inconsistent readings, eg the readings are 
pointing in opposite directions.

<P>
A summary of the templates and readings used to calculate the distance 
between two contigs is displayed in the output window. An example is given 
below:

Offset of contig 348 from the beginning = 7674
</PRE>

<P>
The contig names and numbers are given in the top line. Below this, the
spanning template name, number and length is displayed. Below this the reading
name, whether the reading has been complemented (+: original -: complemented),
number, primer information, starting position, length and contig number. This
is of similar format to that displayed by the read pairs output.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="gap4_98.html#SEC167">Find Read Pairs</A>. The average gap between
the contigs is given and finally the distance in bases between the start of
the second contig and the start of the left most contig in the display.
