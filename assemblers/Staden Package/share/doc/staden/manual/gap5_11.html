<P>
The Gap5 Contig Editor is designed to allow rapid checking and editing of
characters in assembled readings. Very large savings in time can be achieved
by its sophisticated problem finding procedures which automatically direct the
user only to the bases that require attention.  The following is a selection of
screenshots to give an overview of its use.

</P>

<p>
<img src="gap5_contig_editor.screen.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
The figure above shows a screendump from the Contig Editor showing the
consensus for a small region of a contig and the aligned reads.
The main components are, top-most menu bar; common buttons and
controls beneath this; the main name and sequence panels to the left
and right; scrollbars and jog-control; a status text line at the bottom.

</P>
<P>
The names panel on the left can show either reading names or a small
ASCII diagram representing their position, orientation and mapping
quality as a grey-scale. The sequences to the right in the screenshot
has base quality shown in grey (dark being poor, light being good)
with disagreements to the consensus at the top shown in blue. The
consensus line also shows base qualities. You may notice we have a
mixture of long and short sequences, with the longer ones being at the
top. This screenshot is from a mixed assembly of Illumina short-read
data and ABI Sanger-method capillary sequences.

</P>
<P>
One base is drawn in inverse video (a "G"). This is the current
location of the editing cursor. We can move this we arrow keys or
clicking with the left mouse button. It behaves much like the editing
cursor in a word processor and need not be visible in the portion of
the contig we are viewing.

</P>
<P>
Also visible is a set of bases coloured yellow. These are an OLIGO
annotation. Gap5 supports a wide variety of annotation types (often
also referred to as "tags"). These are covered later in more detail.

</P>

<p>
<img src="gap5_contig_editor.traces.png" alt="[picture]">

<P>
This figure is an example of the Trace Display showing three capillary
traces and an Illumina trace from readings in the previous Contig
Editor screendumps. Note that this demonstrates the possibility of
showing the raw trace data for new short-read sequencing technologies,
but typically this is not available due to the high storage size.
