<P>
A common problem is that of base overcalls that will result in perhaps one
reading having and extra base, and all the others being padded by the alignment
routines:

</P>

<PRE>
Read1      ACC*AG
Read2      ACC*AG
Read3      ACC*AG
Read4      ACCCAG
Read5      ACC*AG
Consensus  ACC*AG
</PRE>

<P>
In this first case we see that <CODE>Read4</CODE> has an extra <CODE>C</CODE>, probably
due to an overcall. Check that the trace for <CODE>Read4</CODE> shows an overcall.
It is a good idea to check good quality traces for both strands as well as the
trace with the apparent problem. Also note that enabling "Show reading
quality" (Settings menu) will show the reading quality as grey scales.

</P>
<P>
We now need to remove the column. It would appear that this could be done by
removing the <CODE>*</CODE> from each of Readings 1, 2, 3 and 5, and removing the
<CODE>C</CODE> from Reading 4. However this will only make edits to those five
readings. As we're trying to remove an entire column from the contig, we need
to shift to the left by a single base the position of any readings to the
right. Naturally this is not the ideal method.

</P>
<P>
By placing the editing cursor in the consensus (on the second A) we can
press Delete to remove the entire column. This automatically makes sure that
everything is consistent. If we are editing at 100% consensus cutoff then this
consensus base will be a '-' instead of a '*'. For this to work we need to
make sure that we have "Allow del dash in cons" enabled in the Edit Modes
menu. See section <A HREF="gap4_56.html#SEC67">Editing Modes</A>.
