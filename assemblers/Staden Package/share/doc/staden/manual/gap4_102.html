After assembly, and prior to editing, it can be useful to examine the
quality of the alignments between individual readings and the
sections of the consensus which they overlap. This may
reveal doubtful joins between sections of contigs, poorly aligned
readings, or readings that have been misplaced. By using this analysis
in combination with other gap4
functions 
such as Find internal joins (see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>) and Find repeats (see section <A HREF="gap5_44.html#SEC81">Find Repeats</A>), 
it is also possible to discover if 
readings have been positioned in the
wrong copies of repeat elements. 
The functions for checking the alignment of readings in contigs are
described below.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="gap5_49.html#SEC86">Checking Assemblies</A>.

<P>
If readings are found to be misplaced
or need removing for other reasons, gap4 has functions
for breaking contigs
(see section <A HREF="gap5_51.html#SEC88">Breaking Contigs</A>),
and removing readings
(see section <A HREF="gap5_52.html#SEC89">Disassembling Readings</A>).
These functions can be accessed through the main gap4 Edit menu or from
within the Contig Editor.

</P>
<P>
If readings are removed from contigs to start new contigs of one
reading, these contigs can then be processed by Find internal joins 
(see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>) 
and the Join editor
(see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">The Join Editor</A>), which should
reveal all the other positions at which the reading matches.
