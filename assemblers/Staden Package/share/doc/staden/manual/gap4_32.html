The contig editor can be invoked by double clicking the middle mouse button,
or Alt the left mouse button, 
in any of the displays, ie template, ruler, quality or restriction enzyme
plots. The editor will start up with the editing cursor on the base that 
corresponds to the position clicked on in the Template Display. If more than 
one contig is currently being displayed the editor decides which contig to show
using the following rules. If the user clicks on the Quality Plot, the contig
lines or the Restriction Enzyme Display, the corresponding contigs will
be shown. If the user clicks on a gap between these displays the nearest contig
will be selected. If the user clicks on
the template or reading lines, the editor will show the contig whose left
end is to the left of and closest to the cursor.

</P>
<P>
The long blue vertical line seen in the previous 
figure is the position of the 
editing cursor within a Contig Editor. Each editor will produce its own cursor
and each will be visible. Moving the editing 
cursor within a contig editor automatically moves its cursor within the 
Template Display. Similarly, clicking and dragging the editor cursor with the 
middle mouse button, or Alt left mouse button, within the Template
Display scrolls the associated Contig Editor.

</P>

<P>
The order of the contigs can be changed within the Template Display by
clicking with the middle mouse button, or Alt left mouse button, 
on a contig line and dragging the line to
the new position. The Template Display will update automatically once the 
mouse button is released. The change of a dark yellow template to bright
yellow is indicative that the two contigs are now in consistent positions
and orientations. The order of the contigs in the gap4 database, as 
displayed in the contig selector, can be updated by selecting the 
"Update contig order" command in the Edit menu.

</P>
<P>
By clicking on any of the contig lines in the ruler a popup menu is invoked.
From this, information on the contig can be obtained, the contig editor can be
started, the contig can be complemented, and the templates within the
contig can be highlighted (shown by changing their line width).

</P>
<P>
A list named <CODE>readings</CODE> always exists. It contains the
list of readings that are highlighted in all the currently shown
template displays.  See section <A HREF="gap5_69.html#SEC107">Lists</A>. The highlighting
mechanism used is to draw the readings as thicker, bolder, lines. The
"clear Active Readings" command from the View menu clears this list. The
"highlight reading list" command loads a new set of readings to use for
the "readings" list and then highlights these.

</P>
<P>
To interactively add and remove readings from the active list use the
left mouse button. Clicking on an individual reading will toggle its
state from active to non active and back again. Pressing and holding the
left mouse button, and moving the mouse, will drag out a bounding box.
When the button is released all readings that are contained entirely
within the bounding box will be toggled.

</P>
<P>
Activating a reading (using any of the above methods) when an editor is
running, will also highlight the reading within the editor. Similarly,
highlighting the reading in the editor activates it within the template
display and adds it to the active reading list.

</P>
