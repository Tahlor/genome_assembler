The purpose of this function (which is invoked from the gap4 View menu)
is to use sequences already in the database
to find possible joins between contigs.  Generally these will be joins
that were missed or judged to be unsafe during assembly and this
function allows users to examine the overlaps and decide if they should
be made. During assembly joins may have been missed because of poor
data, or not been made because the sequence was repetitive.  Also it may
be possible to find potential joins by extending the consensus sequences
with the data from the 3' ends of readings which was considered to be
too unreliable to align during assembly i.e. we can search in the
"hidden data".

</P>
<P>
If it has not already occurred, use of this function will automatically
transform the Contig Selector into the Contig Comparator.  Each match
found is plotted as a diagonal line in the Contig Comparator, and is
written as an alignment in the Output Window. The length of the diagonal
line is proportional to the length of the aligned region. If the match
is for two contigs in the same orientation the diagonal will be parallel
to the main diagonal, if they are not in the same orientation the line
will be perpendicular to
the main diagonal. The matches displayed in the Contig Comparator can be
used to invoke the Join Editor (see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">The Join Editor</A>) 
or Contig Editor.  See section <A HREF="gap5_11.html#SEC20">Editing in gap4</A>. 
Alternatively, the "Next" button at the top left of the Contig
Comparator can be used to select each result in turn, starting with the
best, and ending with the worst. When this is in use, users can find the 
match in the Contig Comparator which corresponds to the next result by
placing the cursor over the Next button. The plotted match and the contigs
involved will turn white.

<P>
A typical display from the Contig Comparator is shown in the figure
above.

<P>
To define the match all numbering is relative to base number one in the
contig: matches to the left (i.e.  in the hidden data) have negative
positions, matches off the right end of the contig (i.e. in the hidden
data) have positions greater than that of the contig length.  The
convention for reporting the positions of overlaps is as follows: if
neither contig needs to be complemented the positions are as shown.  If
the program says "contig x in the - sense" then the positions shown
assume contig x has been complemented. For example, in the results given
below the positions for the first overlap are as reported, but those for
the second assume that the contig in the minus sense (i.e. 443) has been
complemented.
