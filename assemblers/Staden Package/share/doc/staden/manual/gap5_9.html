The "Next" button of the contig comparator window automatically invokes the
default operation on the next match from the current active result. This
provides a mechanism to step through each match in turn ensuring that no
matches have been missed.

</P>
<P>
With a single result (set of matches) plotted, the "Next" button simply steps
through each match in turn until all have been seen. Moving the mouse above
the "Next" button, without pressing it, highlights the next match and
displays brief information about it in the status line at the bottom of the
window. To step through the matches in "best first" order, select the "Sort
Matches" option from the relevant name in the Results menu. The exact order is
dependent on the result in question, but is generally arranged to be the most
interesting ones first. 

</P>
<P>
Bringing up another result now directs "Next" to step through each of the new
matches. To change the result that "Next" operates on, use the Result menu to
select the "Use for 'Next'" option in the desired result. Alternatively,
double clicking on a match also causes "Next" to process the list starting
from the selected result.

</P>
<P>
The "Next" scheme remembers any matches that have been previously examined
either by itself or by manually double clicking, and will skip these. To clear
this 'visited' information select "Reset 'Next'" in the Results Manager.

</P>
