The contig comparator is used to plot all templates with readings that span
contigs. That is, the lines drawn on the contig comparator are a visual
representation of the relationship (orientation and overlap) between contigs.
When a template spans more than two contigs, all the combinations of pairs of
contigs are plotted. However such cases are uncommon.

The figure above shows a typical Contig Comparator plot which includes
several types of result in addition to those from Read Pair analysis.

The lines for the read-pairs 
are, by default, shown in blue. The length of the line is the average
length of the two readings within the pair. The slope of the line represents
the relative orientation of the two readings. If they are both the same
orientation (including both complemented) the line is drawn from top left to
bottom right, otherwise the line is drawn from top right to bottom left.

Clicking with the right mouse button on a read pair line brings up a menu
containing, amongst other things, "Invoke template display"
(see section <A HREF="gap4_29.html#SEC36">Template Display</A>).
This creates a template display of the two contigs. The spanning template 
will be coloured bright yellow if the readings on the template are 
consistent with one another, or dark yellow if they are not. The ordering of
the contigs may need to be altered, or one contig may need complementing,
before the readings on the template become consistent. Using the 
"Invoke join editor" command 
(see section <A HREF="gap5_26.html#SEC57">The Join Editor</A>)
from the same menu will bring up the Join Editor 
with the two contigs shown end to end.
