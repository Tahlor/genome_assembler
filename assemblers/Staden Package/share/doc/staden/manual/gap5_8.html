Moving the cursor over plotted results highlights them, and the
information line
gives a brief description of the currently highlighted match. This is in
the form:

</P>
<P>
<VAR>match name</VAR>: <VAR>contig1_number</VAR>@<VAR>position_in_contig1</VAR>,
with <VAR>contig2_number</VAR>@<VAR>position_in_contig2</VAR>,
<VAR>length_of_the_match</VAR>

</P>
<P>
For Find Internal Joins the percentage mismatch is also displayed.

</P>
<P>
Several operations can be performed on each match. Pressing the right
mouse button over a match invokes a popup menu.  This menu will contain
a set of options which depends on the type of result to which the match
corresponds. The following is a complete list, but not all will appear
for each type of result.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>Information</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
Sends a textual description of the match to the Output Window.

<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>

<DT><VAR>Hide</VAR>
<DD>
Removes the match from the Contig Comparator. The match can be revealed
again by using "Reveal all" within the Results Manager.

<DT><VAR>Invoke contig editors</VAR>
<DD>
<DT><VAR>Invoke join editors</VAR>
<DD>
When invoked these options bring up their respective
displays to show the match in greater detail. 

<DT><VAR>Remove</VAR>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
Removes the match from the Contig Comparator. The match
cannot be  revealed again by using "Reveal all" within the
Results Manager.
</DL>

<P>
One of the items in the popup menu may have an asterisk next to it. This is
the default operation which can also be performed by double clicking the left
mouse button on the match.
For Repeat or Find Internal Joins matches this will normally be the Join
Editor, or two Contig Editors when the match is between two points in
the same contig. 

</P>
<P>
The crosshairs can be toggled on and off and a diagonal line going from
top left to bottom right of the plot can also be displayed if required.
This is useful as a guide for moving the contigs such that their matches
lie upon the diagonal line.

</P>
<P>
The "Results" menu on the contig selector window provides a similar mechanism
of accessing results, but at the level of all matches in a particular search.
This is simply a menu driven interface to the Results Manager window
(see section <A HREF="gap5_68.html#SEC106">Results Manager</A>), but containing only the results
relevant to the contig comparator window.
