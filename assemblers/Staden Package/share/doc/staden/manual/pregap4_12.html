When the Run button or Run command (File menu) is used, pregap4 starts
processing the files using the selected modules and their configurations. If
the configuration is invalid an error message will be produced. For example
the following may be written to the error window, and the configure modules
panel will be selected with the problematic module automatically highlighted.

Fri 10 Jul 10:04:25 1998 Run: Module sequence_vector_clip needs configuring
</PRE>

<P>
Assuming that the configuration is correct, the processing will start and
output will be sent to the output window as progress is made. The progress
within each module is shown by a series of fullstops (<CODE>.</CODE>) for each
correctly processed sequence, and an exclamation mark (<CODE>!</CODE>) for each
failed sequence.

</P>

The text output window above shows the early processing stages of 20
sequences. When finished pregap4 will produce a report containing information
from each module and the final list of passed and failed sequences. For
example:

- Report Production -
Passed files:

The list of passed and failed files are written to <I>prefix</I>.passed and
<I>prefix</I>.failed, where <I>prefix</I> is the output filename prefix specified in
the "Files to Process" panel. The reports are written to <I>prefix</I>.report.
The passed and failed files contain the most recent filenames associated with
each sequence. So if a sequence fails early on it could be listed as something
like <CODE>xb54a3.s1SCF.gz</CODE> and if it fails later it will be listed like
<CODE>xb54a3.s1.exp</CODE>. This is because it is the final filename
which is important for later processing, such as for assembly into gap4.

</P>
<P>
A <I>prefix</I>.log file is also created containing a list of passed files,
failed files, and the filename history for each file (the intermediates will
still exist). The format of the passed section is "<I>filename</I>
<CODE>(</CODE><I>file_type</I><CODE>) PASSED</CODE>". The format of the failed section is
"<I>filename</I> <CODE>(</CODE><I>file_type</I><CODE>) ERROR: </CODE><I>error message</I>". The
format of the file history lines is a series of "<I>filename</I>
<CODE>(</CODE><I>file_type</I><CODE>)</CODE>" segments separated by "<CODE>&#60;-</CODE>", with the
original filename listed to the right. Filenames containing Tcl
meta-characters may be `escaped' using curly braces or back slashes. (The Tcl
<CODE>subst</CODE> command may be used to generate the original name.) An example of
a log file follows. This was produced with the command line
"<CODE>pregap4  "Sample 671"  WT5.exp  zf89a2.s1.scf  xb56e5.s1.scf</CODE>".

</P>

<P>
Some modules may also keep their own separate records, such as an assembly
log. Where this is the case, it will be explained in the help specific to that
module.

</P>
<P>
After running pregap4 it is time to either assemble the data (if this was not
done using pregap4) or to edit it. If the data has already been assembled with
Pregap4 then you will need to start up gap4 and use `Open Database'. Otherwise
one of the gap4 assembly functions should be used, with the
<I>filename_prefix</I><CODE>.passed</CODE> file. For more information on this see the
Gap4 manual.
