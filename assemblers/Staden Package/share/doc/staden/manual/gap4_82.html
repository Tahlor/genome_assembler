<H3><A NAME="SEC147" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC147">Checking for Errors</A></H3>

<P>
It is important to check the final sequence for any errors introduced by
incorrect editing. We strongly advise this when making use of the more
dangerous options in "Edit Modes" as it is possible to accidentally make
changes. The editor provides several methods for checking the edits performed
on the data.

</P>
<P>
The search menu contains two search types
(see section <A HREF="gap4_61.html#SEC84">Search for evidence for edits(1)</A>)
and
(see section <A HREF="gap4_61.html#SEC85">Search for evidence for edits(2)</A>).
"Evidence for edits (1)" searches for the next
edited place where none of the original readings
agree with the consensus. This helps to spot cases where entire
columns have been inserted or deleted. "Evidence for edits (2)" performs the
same checks as "Evidence for edits (1)", but on each strand independently. So
it will find all edited places where there is not evidence from both
strands.

</P>
<P>
Further checks may be performed outside the editor. Using the Find Read Pairs
command all templates containing both forward and reverse readings will be
checked to make sure that the relative orientation and distance of the
sequences is correct. See section <A HREF="gap5_45.html#SEC82">Find Read Pairs</A>.

</P>
<P>
Finally, the Check Assembly command can either check the hidden data for each
reading to check that it does not diverge from the consensus sequence, or the
visible data can be examined to locate segments with a high proportion of
disagreements with the consensus.  See section <A HREF="gap5_49.html#SEC86">Check Assembly</A>. Such cases arise from unnoticed section of vector sequence,
chimeric reads, or due to a reading being in the wrong copy of a repeated
element.
