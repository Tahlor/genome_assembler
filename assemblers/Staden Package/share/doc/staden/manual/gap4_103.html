The Check Assembly routine (which is invoked from the gap4 View menu)
is used to check contigs for potentially misassembled readings
by comparing them against the segment of the consensus which
they overlap.  It has two modes of use: the first simply counts the
percentage mismatch between each reading and the consensus it overlaps,
and the second performs an alignment between the hidden data for a
reading and the consensus it overlaps.  If the percentage is above a
user defined maximum, a result is produced.  That is, one mode compares
the "visible" part of the readings, and the other aligns and compares
the hidden data. Results are displayed in
the Output Window and plotted on the main diagonal in the Contig
Comparator. See section <A HREF="gap5_7.html#SEC12">Contig Comparator</A>.

</P>
<P>
From the Contig Comparator the user can invoke the Contig Editor to
examine the alignment of any problem reading. See section <A HREF="gap5_11.html#SEC20">Editing in gap4</A>. If the reading appears to be correctly positioned
the user can either edit it, or in the case of poor alignment of the
hidden data, place a tag, so that it does not produce a result if the
search is done again.  Note however such data will then also be ignored
by the automatic double stranding routine. See section <A HREF="gap4_108.html#SEC179">Double Stranding</A>.
A typical textual output from the analysis of hidden data is shown below.

Users select either to search only one contig ("single"), all contigs
("all contigs"), or a subset of contigs contained in a "file" or a
"list". If "file" or "list" is selected the "browse" button will be
activated and clicking on it will invoke a file or list browser. If a
single contig is selected the "Contig identifier" dialogue will be
activated and users should enter a contig name.

</P>
<P>
Selecting between analysing the visible or hidden data is done by
clicking on "yes" or "no" in the "Use cutoff data" dialogue. All
alignments that are worse than "Maximum percentage of mismatches" will
produce a result in the Output Window and the Contig Comparator.  If
"Use cutoff data" is selected then dialogue to enable the user to
restrict the quality and length of the hidden data that the program
aligns is activated.  First, to avoid finding very short
mismatching regions (where percentage mismatch figures could be very
high) users can set a "Minimum length of alignment" figure. Secondly to
ensure that the hidden data is not so bad that alignments will
necessarily be poor, the program uses the following algorithm. It slides
a window of size "Window size for good data scan" along the hidden data
for each reading and stops if it finds a window that contains more than
"Max dashes in scan window" non-ACGT characters.

</P>
<P>
To check the used data for each reading 
("Use cutoff data" is set to "No") the program
compares all segments of size 'window' against the consensus sequence 
that they lie above (obviously no alignment is required).
If the percentage mismatch within any segment is above the
specified amount, then the entire 'alignment' of the reading and consensus
is displayed. Note that in the output the program will first give the percentage
mismatch over the window length, and then the percentage over the whole reading. 
To check the overall percentage mismatch of readings, 
simply set the "Window size for used data" to be longer than the
reading lengths. To check for divergence of segments within readings
set the window size accordingly.

The "Information" window produced by selecting "Information" from the
Contig Comparator "Results" menu produces a summary of the results
sorted in order os percentage mismatch.

<P>
By clicking with the right mouse button
on results plotted in the Contig Comparator a pop-up menu is revealed
which can be used to invoke the Contig Editor
(see section <A HREF="gap5_11.html#SEC20">Editing in gap4</A>). The editor will start
up with the cursor positioned on the problem reading. If the reading is
found to be misplaced it can be marked for removal from within the Editor
(see section <A HREF="gap4_62.html#SEC100">Remove Reading</A>).
However, prior to this it may be beneficial to use some of the other
analyses such as Find internal joins (see section <A HREF="gap5_42.html#SEC79">Find Internal Joins</A>) and Find repeats (see section <A HREF="gap5_44.html#SEC81">Find Repeats</A>), which may help to find its correct location. Both of these
functions produce results plotted in the Contig Comparator
(see section <A HREF="gap5_7.html#SEC12">Contig Comparator</A>) and any
alternative locations will give matches on the same vertical or
horizontal projection as the problem reading.
