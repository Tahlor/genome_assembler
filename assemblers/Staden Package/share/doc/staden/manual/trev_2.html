Trace files can be opened either on the command line or from within Trev.  
In both cases it is possible to open several traces at once. In this case trev
will add Next File, Previous File and Goto File buttons to allow quick
navigation between traces.

</P>
<P>
On the command line, this is simply done by specifying several files. With the
"Open" dialogue from within trev multiple files may be selected by dragging
with the left mouse button or using shift+left button and control+left button
to extend regions or to toggle loading of individual files.

<DL COMPACT>

usage: trev [-{ABI,ALF,EXP,SCF,PLN,Any}] [-edits <VAR>value</VAR>]
[-editscf] [-xmag <VAR>value</VAR>] [-ymag <VAR>value</VAR>] [-restrict]
[<VAR>tracefilename</VAR> ...]

<P>
<DT><CODE>-ABI, -ALF, -EXP, -SCF, -PLN, -Any</CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Defaults to Any. These define the possible input trace formats
available. Currently these are 'ABI', 'ALF', experiment
(see section <A HREF="formats_18.html#SEC40">Experiment File</A>), 'SCF'
(see section <A HREF="formats_3.html#SEC3">scf</A>), plain ASCII text or 'any' in which case
the program attempts to establish the file format from information
contained within the trace file. 

<P>
<DT><CODE>-edits <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Defaults to 1. If <VAR>value</VAR> is 1, the trace sequence can be
edited. If <VAR>value</VAR> is 0, no edit line is displayed in Trev and the
sequence may not be edited.

<P>
<DT><CODE>-editscf</CODE>
<DD>
Optional. By default writing to SCF is disabled for safety and reasons of
preference (we feel that all edits should be contained within an associated
Experiment File thus leaving the original trace file intact). Specifying
<CODE>-editscf</CODE> allows writing to SCF files.

<P>
<DT><CODE>-pregap_mode</CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Only used by Pregap4. This adds a Reject button to Trev
and disables certain file operations. This argument should only be used by
programs that run Trev as subprocesses for processing batches of files.

<P>
<DT><CODE>-restrict</CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Restricts the use of the trace editor to a single file by
disabling the ability to open another file from within Trev. The main
use of this option is for calling Trev from within scripts.

<P>
<DT><CODE>-xmag <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Defaults to 150. Specifies the magnification along the X axis
of the trace. Larger values represent higher magnifications.

<P>
<DT><CODE>-ymag <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Optional. Defaults to 10. Specifies the magnification along the Y axis
of the trace. The value should be between 10 and 100 with 10 showing all
the trace and 100 being the largest magnification.

<P>
To open a trace file select the "Open..." command from the File menu.
This brings up a file browser from where the trace name can be selected.

</P>
<P>See section <A HREF="interface_12.html#SEC14">File Browser</A>. The format of the trace
file should be selected from the row of Format buttons. Currently these
are 'ABI', 'ALF', Experiment File (see section <A HREF="formats_18.html#SEC40">Experiment File</A>), 'SCF' (see section <A HREF="formats_3.html#SEC3">SCF File</A>), plain ASCII
text or 'any' in which case the program attempts to establish the file format
from information contained within the trace file. Opening an experiment
file opens the trace file named within the experiment file. Double
clicking on the trace name will open this trace file.

</P>
<P>
If a trace file is already open, it is closed before the new one is
opened. If the previous trace has been edited, but not saved, a dialogue
box is displayed, asking if you wish to save the file before loading a
new file. Selecting "Yes" will automatically save the file to its
current filename. Selecting "No" will discard any changes that have been
made.
