Once a location has been found where an edit needs to be made there are two
possible methods of resolving the problem. Assuming that the edit is a base
replacement, the first way is to simply replace the differing base with the
corrected base. This adds the new base at 100% quality.  A second solution is
to set the confidence of the differing base to 0.  Assuming that we have the
quality cutoff set to zero or more, this will remove the differing base
from the consensus calculation, thus enabling the consensus to be 100%
identical.

</P>
<P>
Both of these methods may be used when replacing bases in the consensus and
are selectable using the "Edit Modes" menu. Fixing a problem by adjusting its
confidence leaves the original, conflicting, base visible on the screen.
However if the changed reading is the only one on a strand then adjusting the
confidence means that the point only has good data on one strand.
