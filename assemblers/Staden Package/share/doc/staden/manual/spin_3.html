<P>
Spin is an interactive and graphical 
program for analysing and comparing sequences. It contains functions to
search for restriction sites, consensus sequences/motifs and protein 
coding regions, can analyse the composition of the sequence and
translate DNA to protein. 
It also contains functions for locating segments of similarity within and
between sequences, and for finding global and local alignments between pairs of
sequences. 
To help assess the statistical significance of comparisons the program can
calculate tables of expected and observed score frequencies for each
score level.
Most analytical functions which operate on single sequences
add their graphical results to a "SPIN Sequence Plot" that is associated 
with the sequence being analysed. (An exception is the restriction enzyme 
search which produces its own separate window.) Most functions which compare
pairs of sequences add their results to a "SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot".
The SPIN Sequence Plot and the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot each have
associated sequence display windows: the Sequence Display and the 
Sequence Comparison Display. These allow the text of the sequences to be
viewed and use cursors to show the corresponding positions in the graphical
displays.
The graphical plots can be zoomed, and cursors or crosshairs can be
used to locate the positions of the individual results. Plots can be 
superimposed.

<P>
Spin's main single sequence analytical functions are accessed via the 
Statistics,
Translation and Search menus.
The "Statistics" menu contains options to count and plot the base composition 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_13.html#SEC23">Plot base composition</A>)
and also to count the dinucleotide frequencies
(
see section <A HREF="spin_12.html#SEC22">Count Dinucleotide Frequencies</A>).

</P>
<P>
The "Translation" menu contains options to set the genetic code
(
see section <A HREF="spin_15.html#SEC25">Set genetic code</A>), translate to protein
(
see section <A HREF="spin_16.html#SEC26">Translation - general</A>),
find open reading frames and write the results in either feature
table format or as fasta format protein sequence files
(
see section <A HREF="spin_17.html#SEC27">Find open reading frames</A>), and to calculate 
codon tables.

</P>
<P>
The "Search" menu contains a variety of different searching techniques.
"Protein genes" has four methods for finding protein genes
(
see section <A HREF="spin_28.html#SEC38">Codon usage method</A>)
(
see section <A HREF="spin_30.html#SEC40">Author test</A>),
(
see section <A HREF="spin_29.html#SEC39">Positional base preferences</A>)
(accessed as a subcomponent of the Codon Usage Method), and
(
see section <A HREF="spin_31.html#SEC41">Uneven positional base preferences</A>). There is also a method to search for tRNA genes
(
see section <A HREF="spin_33.html#SEC43">tRNA search</A>).
It is also possible to perform subsequence or string searches 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_23.html#SEC33">Subsequence search</A>) and restriction enzyme searches
(
see section <A HREF="spin_18.html#SEC28">Restriction enzyme search</A>). 
There are searches for start 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_26.html#SEC36">Start codon search</A>) and stop codons 
(
see section <A HREF="spin_27.html#SEC37">Stop codon search</A>), splice junction
searches (
see section <A HREF="spin_32.html#SEC42">Splice site search</A>), and
general motif searches using weight matrices (
see section <A HREF="spin_24.html#SEC34">Motif search</A>).
