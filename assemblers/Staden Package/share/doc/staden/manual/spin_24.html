This option is used to search for motifs such as binding sites. The
motifs are defined using weight matrices which are stored as files 
that need to be created beforehand. These matrices are usually
calculated from alignments of trusted examples of the motif. The
<CODE>make_weights</CODE> program can be used to create weight matrices from
sets of aligned sequences
(see section <A HREF="manpages_18.html#SEC105">Make_weights</A>)
We also plan to build up a library of matrix files which we will place
in our ftp site.

An example weight matrix file is shown below. It consists
of a title record; a record defining the motif size, an offset and the score
range; 2 records which need to be present but which are ignored; 4 records
defining the base frequencies calculated from the trusted examples.

An example weight matrix file is shown below. The first line gives the
title ('Mount acceptors' in this example). The next line gives the motif 
length (18), the "mark position" (15), and the minimum and maximum
scores (0.0 and 10.0). The "mark position" is an offset which is added
to the position of any matches reported by the search routine in
spin. The next two lines are ignored by the programs. The first of them
gives the matrix column positions, and the next gives the total counts
in each column. The final lines (4 for DNA weight matrices) give the
counts for each character type at each position in the motif. These
counts are converted into weights that are used during the searches. Any
position in a sequence which scores at least as high as the minimum
score is reported as a match, and if the results are plotted they are
scaled to fit the range defined by the minimum and maximum scores.
