<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="pregap4_toc.html#SEC2">Organisation of the Pregap4 Manual</A></H1>

<P>
Pregap4 is a relatively simple program to use. It is also very flexible
and extendable, and so much of the manual is taken up by explaining to
programmers and system managers how it can be configured. The average
user need not be concerned with these details.

</P>
<P>
The Introductory section of the manual is meant to give an overview of
the program: what it is for, the files it uses and functions it
performs, and how to use it.
It is very important for all users to have a basic
understanding of the files used by pregap4 and the processes through
which it can pass their data
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_4.html#SEC4">Summary of the Files used and the Processing Steps</A>).
The next section of the Introduction
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_10.html#SEC10">Pregap4 Menus</A>)
tabulates the program's menus. This is followed by an overview of the
pregap4 user interface
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_5.html#SEC5">Introduction to the Pregap4 User Interface</A>) which should give a clear idea of how to actually use the
program, and concludes the introductory section.

</P>
<P>
More detail about how to define the set of files to be
processed
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_11.html#SEC15">Specifying Files to Process</A>) is
followed by a section showing 
how to run pregap4 and giving examples of its use
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_12.html#SEC16">Running Pregap4</A>).
Next are sections
on configuring the pregap4 user interface
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_13.html#SEC17">Configuring the Pregap4 User Interface</A>).

</P>
<P>
The next part of the manual
describes how to use the Configure Modules Window to
select the modules to apply and to set their parameters
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_14.html#SEC20">Configuring Modules</A>).
This is one of the longest and most detailed parts of the manual in that
it describes how to configure all the current possible modules, many of
which will not be available at all sites, and several of which perform
identical functions. Obviously, only the entries which describe 
the functions that are available at a site, are of interest.

</P>
<P>
One of the important tasks of pregap4 is to make sure that each
reading's Experiment file contains all the information needed by gap4 to
ensure the accuracy of the final consensus sequence and to make the
project proceed as efficiently as possible. Pregap4 provides several methods
for sourcing this information. One of these, as for example employed at
the Sanger Centre in the UK, is to encode some information about a
reading in its reading name. Pregap4 contains flexible mechanisms to
enable a variety of the "Naming schemes" or "Naming conventions" to be
used as a source of information to augment the Experiment files
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_47.html#SEC53">Pregap4 Naming Schemes</A>).
Alternatively pregap4 can use simple text databases as an information source
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_53.html#SEC59">Information Sources</A>), or the user
can set up some Experiment file record types for use with a batch of readings
(see section <A HREF="formats_19.html#SEC41">Experiment file format record types</A>).

</P>
<P>
The rest of the manual deals with increasingly complicated matters, and
the average user should never need to consult these sections. First
there is a section on adding an removing modules
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_56.html#SEC62">Adding and Removing Modules</A>). This describes
how to control the list of modules which appear in the Configure Modules
Window. The package is usually shipped with this list set to contain
more modules than are likely to be available at any one site and so it
might be found useful to remove those that are not available.

</P>
<P>
The next two sections, as their names imply, are for programmers only
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_57.html#SEC63">Low Level Pregap4 Configuration</A>)
and
(see section <A HREF="pregap4_91.html#SEC97">Writing New Modules</A>).
