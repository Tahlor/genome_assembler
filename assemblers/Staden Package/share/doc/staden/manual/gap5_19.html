<P>
The list named "readings" is used for all sequences selected in all
editors. This is automatically updated whenever a sequence is selected
or deselected.

</P>
<P>
Inividual sequence names can be (de)selected by clicking on them with
the left mouse button, or clicking and dragging out a region. This works
well for a few sequences.

</P>
<P>
If you need to select all readings overlapping a specific consensus base
or a region of consensus bases mark the range of the consensus you wish
to select over by pressing and dragging the left mouse button (as if you
were going to create an annotation) and then either right click in the
consensus or use the Commands menu to choose Select Reads. When using
the Commands menu you get a dialogue asking for confirmation of the
start and end positions and the option of whether to select sequences
that overlap this range or only those which are entirely containing
within that range. When using the right-click popup on the consensus it
simply takes the defaults (overlapping sequences).

</P>
<P>
Deselection follows the same procedure.
