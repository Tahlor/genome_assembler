The primary interface to creating, viewing and editing notes is the Note
Selector window. This is accessable from a variety of places, 
including anywhere a contig or reading name (or line in a graphical plot) is
displayed, and also by using the "Edit Notebooks" command in the main gap4 Edit
menu.

The Note Selector initially starts up showing the database notes (unless
selected from a specific contig or reading plot). The picture above shows three
notes attached to the main gap4 database record. These are of type <CODE>OPEN</CODE>
and <CODE>RAWD</CODE>, both of which have a specific meaning to gap4, and type
<CODE>COMM</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The View Menu is used to see a list of notes for readings or contigs.
If Reading Notes or Contig Notes is selected, the interface will ask for
a reading or contig
identifier by adding an extra line to the Note Selector Window, just beneath
the menus. Typing one in and pressing return will then list the notes for
that reading or contig. 

</P>
<P>
To speed up selection, it is possible to use the right
mouse button on the Contig Selector Window and in the contig rulers at the
bottom of many plots (such as the Template Display), to select the "List Notes"
option. This will start the Note Selector if it is not already running, and
will direct it to display notes for the desired contig. Similarly, the
right mouse button can be used 
to popup a menu from a reading in the Template Display or
from a reading name in the Contig Editor.

</P>
<P>
To edit a note, double click anywhere in the Note Selector on the line
for the note.

</P>
<P>
To delete a note, single click on the note line to highlight it and then select
"Delete" from the Note Selector Edit menu. To delete several notes
at once, first highlight a range by left clicking and dragging the mouse to
mark a region of notes, and then use Delete. Alternatively notes may be
deleted by double clicking to bring up the note editor and selecting Delete
from the Note Editor File menu.

</P>
<P>
To create a new note use the "New" command from the Edit menu. The note will
be added to whatever data type is currently shown. To create a
note for a particular contig, select that contig using the Contig Notes option
in the View menu, and then use New to create a new note. New notes
will have type <CODE>COMM</CODE> and the contents can be in any format.
