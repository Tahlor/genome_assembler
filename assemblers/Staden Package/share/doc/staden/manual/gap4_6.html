<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="gap4_toc.html#SEC6">Introduction to the gap4 User Interface</A></H2>

<P>
Gap4 has a main window from which all the main options are selected from
menus. When a database is open it also has a Contig Selector which will
transform into a Contig Comparator whenever needed. In addition many of
the gap4 functions, such as the Contig Editor or the Template Display
will create their own windows when they are activated. All the graphical
displays and the Contig Editor can be scrolled in register. The base of the
graphical display
windows usually contains an Information Line for showing short textual
data about results or items touched by the mouse cursor. Gap4 is
best operated using a three button mouse, but alternative keybindings
are available. Full details of the user interface
are described elsewhere
(see section <A HREF="interface_2.html#SEC2">User Interface</A>), and here we give an
introduction based around a series of screenshots.

</P>
<P>
The main window (shown below) contains an Output window for
textual results, an Error window for error messages, and a series of
menus arranged along the top. The contents of the two text windows can
be searched, edited and saved. Each set of results is preceded by
a header containing the time and date when it was generated.

</P>
<P>
Some of the text will be underlined and shaded differently. These are
hyperlinks which perform an operation when clicked (with the left mouse
button) on, typically invoking a graphical display such as the contig
editor. Clicking on these with the right mouse button will bring up a menu of
additional operations. At present only a few commands (Show Relationships and 
the Search functions) produce hypertext, but if there is sufficient interest
this may be expanded on.
