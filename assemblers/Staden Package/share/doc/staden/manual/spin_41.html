<P>
Spin has several displays. The first is
a top level window from which all the main options are selected and
which receives textual results. 
Most analytical functions which operate on single sequences
add their graphical results to a "SPIN Sequence Plot" that is associated 
with the sequence being analysed. (An exception is the restriction enzyme 
search which produces its own separate window.) Most functions which compare
pairs of sequences add their results to a "SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot".
The SPIN Sequence Plot and the SPIN Sequence Comparison Plot each have
associated sequence display windows: the Sequence Display and the 
Sequence Comparison Display. These allow the text of the sequences to be
viewed and use cursors to show the corresponding positions in the graphical
displays.

<P>
Spin is
best operated using a three button mouse, but alternative keybindings
are available. Full details of the user interface
are described elsewhere
(see section <A HREF="interface_2.html#SEC2">User Interface</A>).

</P>
<P>
The main window (shown below) contains an Output Window for
textual results, an Error window for error messages, and a series of
menus arranged along the top
(see section <A HREF="spin_10.html#SEC11">Spin menus</A>).
The contents of the two text windows can
be searched, edited and saved. Each set of results is preceded by
a header containing the time and date when it was generated.

<P>
As can be seen 
the main menu bar contains File, View, Options, Sequences, Statistics,
Translation, Comparison, Search and Emboss menus.
